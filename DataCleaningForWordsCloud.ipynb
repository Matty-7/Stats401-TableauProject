       "  \"Fee Note: For the 76ers, the NBA trade deadline may be more about reducing the salary cap than adding reinforcements! As long as Embiid stays healthy and Harden continues to pass first and serve as a triple-double threat, they can make progress in the playoffs. Therefore, the 76ers are not expected to make any major lineup changes before the NBA trade deadline at 3 pm on Thursday (4 am on February 10th, Beijing time)! ! ! But they want a backup center, a backup point guard, and a shooter in the trade market. According to a report from Yahoo Sports on Saturday, Jazz big man Vanderbilt is the 76ers' main signing target to replace Embiid. However, the Jazz want a first-round pick to trade the five-year veteran! The 6-foot-9 Vanderbilt is a power forward but has the ability to guard all three frontcourt positions. The Pacers consider him an attractive option. The Jazz have discussed the possibility of trading Vanderbilt and Beasley to the Knicks, Trail Blazers and Hawks in a package! Philadelphia may need a third-party team to get involved and make a trade for him. Because Philadelphia doesn't have a ton of tradable assets, but the 76ers have an available roster spot, they might be in a position to get a player in need on the buyout market! According to Spotrac data, the 76ers currently have a total salary of $151.4 million on the roster. They have to take off $1.1 million to get under the league's $150.3 million luxury tax threshold! This is why Korkmaz (salary is $5 million this season) and Springer (salary is $2.1 million) have been mentioned as candidates for the 76ers to consider trading! PhillyVoice: First reported that Georges Niang ($3.4 million) and House ($4.1 million) may also be candidates for the trade! (Because Niang has trade value) According to sources, second-year guard Springer does not have much trade value in the league! #Philadelphia76ers#\",\n",

       "  \"The Lakers' 4-for-2 trade plan involved Westbrook in exchange for Irving + Joha. The Nets had to rebuild suddenly, and Irving applied for a trade to the Nets. NBA reporter Shams reported that Irving prefers to be traded before the trade deadline. Another reporter, Woj, reported that Durant was surprised that Irving applied for a trade. He said that the entire team, including Durant, felt caught off guard. It's really surprising, because the Nets are currently ranked fourth in the Eastern Conference, the situation is still very good, and they have hope of winning the championship. Irving applied for a trade at this time, which hurt the Nets very much. Famous reporter Haynes reported that Irving informed the Nets that if he is not traded to other teams, he will leave directly as a free agent in the offseason. Durant also applied for a trade to the Nets last offseason, but he ultimately stayed with the Nets. Obviously, Irving and Durant's situation is different. Durant's contract still has four years, and there is no doubt about Durant's playing attitude. As long as he plays, he will go all out. Irving's contract expires at the end of this season, and his playing attitude is far inferior to Durant's. Irving applied for a trade, and the Lakers became the most popular next destination. During last offseason, the Lakers hoped to acquire Irving. In order to get Irving, the Lakers proposed a trade plan of Westbrook + 2 first-round picks, but the Nets rejected it. The Lakers once again offered Irving, and Westbrook + 2 first-round picks are still the main body of the transaction. ESPN reported an epic 4-for-2 trade plan. The specific content is that the Lakers will send Westbrook, Lonnie Walker, and two first-round picks to acquire Irving and Joe Harris. Goodbye Westbrook, the Lakers still have to send him away. Although his performance has improved after switching to the bench, the Lakers are worried that Westbrook will be targeted in the playoffs. Westbrook's poor shooting characteristics are indeed easy to target in the playoffs. Irving has a problem with his playing attitude, but he is very capable, and his partnership with James is very effective. In the three years that James and Irving worked together, they reached the finals and won a championship. In this epic 4-for-2 trade plan, the Lakers not only got Irving, but also shooter Joe Harris. This season, Joe Harris shot 40.9% from three-point range. Throughout his career, Joe Harris has shot 43.6% from three-point range. The arrival of Irving and Joe Harris will greatly improve the Lakers' three-point shooting ability, and this is the Lakers' weakest shortcoming now. Although the Lakers are only ranked 12th in the Western Conference, they are very close to the teams in front of them. As long as the Lakers do not suffer serious injuries after the trade, it will be almost easy to get a play-off spot. As long as they can play in the play-offs, the Lakers can compete for the championship. First they traded for Rui Hachimura, and then they were expected to trade for Irving and Joe Harris. The Lakers went crazy in the trading market. For the Nets, after the transaction, their hopes of winning the championship will be greatly reduced. Westbrook has provided very little help to the Nets, and Lonnie Walker is like a nerve knife. After the trade, their strength dropped a notch, and their hopes of winning the championship were basically dashed. But the Nets had no choice. Irving applied for a trade, and the Nets could only stop their losses. They gave away Joe Harris' big contract and got young Lonnie Walker and two first-round picks. It doesn’t matter where you play this season. From the moment Irving applied for a trade, the Nets were already passive. Maybe the Nets are already regretting why they didn't send him away last offseason.\",\n",
       "  'NBA legend Vince Carter talked about the Nets, a team he once played for, on the \"GetUp\" program. \"The Nets have a chance to compete for the championship. When they stayed healthy, the team\\'s momentum was very good. I think Ben Simmons is the X factor. Can Simmons be aggressive? Can Simmons break into the penalty area and force the opponent to defend? Him? \"The Nets were doing great before KD got injured, and they have shooters now, and they can space the floor. Sometimes Simmons is just not aggressive enough. He must be aggressive, because in the playoffs, opponents will choose Simmons to defeat them. ” #Brooklyn Nets #Brooklyn Nets'],\n",

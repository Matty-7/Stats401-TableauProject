4.87E+15,MrEOuwy6N,7796217480,Harden’s time machine Lucky,"Fee Note: For the 76ers, the NBA trade deadline may be more about reducing the salary cap than adding reinforcements! As long as Embiid stays healthy and Harden continues to pass first and serve as a triple-double threat, they can make progress in the playoffs. Therefore, the 76ers are not expected to make any major lineup changes before the NBA trade deadline at 3 pm on Thursday (4 am on February 10th, Beijing time)! ! ! But they want a backup center, a backup point guard, and a shooter in the trade market. According to a report from Yahoo Sports on Saturday, Jazz big man Vanderbilt is the 76ers' main signing target to replace Embiid. However, the Jazz want a first-round pick to trade the five-year veteran! The 6-foot-9 Vanderbilt is a power forward but has the ability to guard all three frontcourt positions. The Pacers consider him an attractive option. The Jazz have discussed the possibility of trading Vanderbilt and Beasley to the Knicks, Trail Blazers and Hawks in a package! Philadelphia may need a third-party team to get involved and make a trade for him. Because Philadelphia doesn't have a ton of tradable assets, but the 76ers have an available roster spot, they might be in a position to get a player in need on the buyout market! According to Spotrac data, the 76ers currently have a total salary of $151.4 million on the roster. They have to take off $1.1 million to get under the league's $150.3 million luxury tax threshold! This is why Korkmaz (salary is $5 million this season) and Springer (salary is $2.1 million) have been mentioned as candidates for the 76ers to consider trading! PhillyVoice: First reported that Georges Niang ($3.4 million) and House ($4.1 million) may also be candidates for the trade! (Because Niang has trade value) According to sources, second-year guard Springer does not have much trade value in the league! #Philadelphia76ers#",,,,Philadelphia 76ers,0,6,1,2/5/23 22:49,Weibo web version,['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/008vC8jely1haszyuivtsj30it0fnk1e.jpg'],,

4.87E+15,MrrY088cn,6323290897,Zhuge basketball talk,"The Lakers' 4-for-2 trade plan involved Westbrook in exchange for Irving + Joha. The Nets had to rebuild suddenly, and Irving applied for a trade to the Nets. NBA reporter Shams reported that Irving prefers to be traded before the trade deadline. Another reporter, Woj, reported that Durant was surprised that Irving applied for a trade. He said that the entire team, including Durant, felt caught off guard. It's really surprising, because the Nets are currently ranked fourth in the Eastern Conference, the situation is still very good, and they have hope of winning the championship. Irving applied for a trade at this time, which hurt the Nets very much. Famous reporter Haynes reported that Irving informed the Nets that if he is not traded to other teams, he will leave directly as a free agent in the offseason. Durant also applied for a trade to the Nets last offseason, but he ultimately stayed with the Nets. Obviously, Irving and Durant's situation is different. Durant's contract still has four years, and there is no doubt about Durant's playing attitude. As long as he plays, he will go all out. Irving's contract expires at the end of this season, and his playing attitude is far inferior to Durant's. Irving applied for a trade, and the Lakers became the most popular next destination. During last offseason, the Lakers hoped to acquire Irving. In order to get Irving, the Lakers proposed a trade plan of Westbrook + 2 first-round picks, but the Nets rejected it. The Lakers once again offered Irving, and Westbrook + 2 first-round picks are still the main body of the transaction. ESPN reported an epic 4-for-2 trade plan. The specific content is that the Lakers will send Westbrook, Lonnie Walker, and two first-round picks to acquire Irving and Joe Harris. Goodbye Westbrook, the Lakers still have to send him away. Although his performance has improved after switching to the bench, the Lakers are worried that Westbrook will be targeted in the playoffs. Westbrook's poor shooting characteristics are indeed easy to target in the playoffs. Irving has a problem with his playing attitude, but he is very capable, and his partnership with James is very effective. In the three years that James and Irving worked together, they reached the finals and won a championship. In this epic 4-for-2 trade plan, the Lakers not only got Irving, but also shooter Joe Harris. This season, Joe Harris shot 40.9% from three-point range. Throughout his career, Joe Harris has shot 43.6% from three-point range. The arrival of Irving and Joe Harris will greatly improve the Lakers' three-point shooting ability, and this is the Lakers' weakest shortcoming now. Although the Lakers are only ranked 12th in the Western Conference, they are very close to the teams in front of them. As long as the Lakers do not suffer serious injuries after the trade, it will be almost easy to get a play-off spot. As long as they can play in the play-offs, the Lakers can compete for the championship. First they traded for Rui Hachimura, and then they were expected to trade for Irving and Joe Harris. The Lakers went crazy in the trading market. For the Nets, after the transaction, their hopes of winning the championship will be greatly reduced. Westbrook has provided very little help to the Nets, and Lonnie Walker is like a nerve knife. After the trade, their strength dropped a notch, and their hopes of winning the championship were basically dashed. But the Nets had no choice. Irving applied for a trade, and the Nets could only stop their losses. They gave away Joe Harris' big contract and got young Lonnie Walker and two first-round picks. It doesn’t matter where you play this season. From the moment Irving applied for a trade, the Nets were already passive. Maybe the Nets are already regretting why they didn't send him away last offseason.",,,,,0,0,2,2/4/23 14:07,NBA Super Talk,['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/006TVSORly1harfarm9irj30u00gudkv.jpg'],,

Because you all know that Harden is no longer the Rockets player. Harden's level has already dropped to the same level as Irving. I said: Irving has won the championship as the main player. He said: What else does Irving have besides championships? ? My brother Deng also has a championship! I said: World Championship champion, right? Oh, Irving was the MVP of that World Championship. He said: Irving has poor team leadership skills! I said: Irving is positioned as a top scorer, and he came to the Nets to assist KD in winning the championship together. Could it be that since the Lakers' record is so bad, you also want to say that James has poor team leadership skills? At this time, they knew that a team not only has the boss, but also four role players, but they didn't mention it at all, because they wanted to blackmail Irving! He said: Irving leads the team to fight for the No. 1 pick! I said: The Cavaliers were ninth in the Eastern Conference that year, and he had nothing to say about the number one pick that they got thanks to the good luck of the little master. He said: Irving is not worth 200 million in four years! I said: Irving and his team have never proposed 200 million in four years. In theory, 200 million in four years is the highest salary that Irving can get. He has nothing to say after being spread by Hupu headline-makers. I responded with a picture of an American Yang Yi scolding Irving and the fans. He had nothing to say and I said: Irving provoked you and provoked you? Why did you come to the Nets section to criticize Irving? He has nothing to say except for what his NBA audience knows: Harden has now declined to the level of a player with Irving. Only they don't know (maybe they also know, but they just don't want to admit it) I said: I have seen through you all a long time ago. You are here to criticize Irving just because you are jealous that Irving has surpassed Harden. He has nothing to say. There will definitely be many unpleasant comments about Irving, Irving fans, and others in the next article. My words, hahaha, I expected it a long time ago. Don't worry, Ben and I won't care.

4.86E+15,Mq7hRve6N,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[This throw] While the game between the Warriors and the Grizzlies was going on, I had already begun to conceive of a character relationship diagram for ""The Legend of Zhen Huan in Jinzhou"". The idea had nothing to do with Curry throwing braces. His ejection occurred at the end of the fourth quarter, but the idea of a relationship map took hold last night. Miles may leave the team. This news seems to touch me more than the dream-chasing lunge punch knocking Poole down. The premonition of the Warriors' disintegration has never been so strong and real. The connotation of Curry's throw is by no means simple. Expressing dissatisfaction with Poole's mindless choice was only the direct cause of its occurrence and the fuse that ignited the bomb. There were too many factors that accumulated Curry's emotions to the critical point. Much content. The team's record of less than 50% winning rate, the ambiguity of the direction of progress, the looming contradictions from the outside perspective, and the concentrated pop-up of various news last night (for them, it was the morning), all indicate the hidden power of the internal game. Seek external transfer targets. These contents are spliced together, and they may be blinded by the calm playing style, or they may be covered up by the well-trained expression control in front of the camera, but they have truly weakened Curry's immunity to tolerate idiots - can he lose this game? ? Can you afford to lose? The team was struggling painfully on the verge of tearing. The short-term victory could more or less stitch up some wounds that were not in critical locations, allowing them to have the strength to finish the long run, leaving the problem to the wisdom of the vacation. If the Warriors lose the game because of Poole's outrageous three-pointer, maybe he is the pawn who breaks the silence and even overturns the table, and what follows is likely to be a series of chain reactions. Poole's winning goal briefly redeemed himself, allowing all parties to once again find an excuse to suppress their anger. However, the conflict will not be eliminated just because of a hug in the player tunnel. Curry's grievance is not limited to Poole, and Poole offends far more than just Curry. Although the two are at the center of the storm, almost everyone on the team is involved in the storm. If the filming of ""The Legend of Zhen Huan"" really starts, the story will have three sets of conflicts: conflicts in the overt lines and conflicts in the lineup. Hidden line conflict, the choice of team direction. Essential conflict, confirmation of the main body of the team. We explain them separately. The contradiction in the lineup. Why did Cole take Poole, take Looney, and start with five small players? Doesn't he know that the defense of three defenders and five small defenders is poor, and Looney is easy to use? Everyone knows these situations? Don't think the coaching staff is that stupid, Kerr certainly knows. But this arrangement is not what fans think, it is purely out of considerations of balancing the team's status. In terms of lineup arrangement, no matter how you choose, there are contradictions: Chai Meng and Looney both lack outside threats, which is a spatial contradiction; the three guards not only suffer from matchups and rebounds, but they are also unable to lead top pick-and-rollers. This is a contrapuntal contradiction. The player who can balance the contradiction is Wiggins. He has both shooting and leading defense. No matter which combination he is placed in, he can alleviate the contradiction to a certain extent. But after his comeback, his condition was extremely poor, which intensified the space conflict in the starting lineup, so the coaching staff chose to remove Dream Chaser and Looney, treating them as two No. 5 positions to arrange rotations. The first benefit of this arrangement is room for upgrades, and it also protects Looney to a certain extent, allowing his time to be closer to the 20 minutes that Cole was used to. The disadvantage is naturally that the defense is under huge pressure at the beginning, either being impacted or fouled and exploding. In the game against the Grizzlies, Wiggins took a truce. Cole still did not put Looney in the starting lineup. Instead, he arranged for Kuminga, who also lacked space value, to start. This is because he needs a player to match Morant. From this we can see how important a healthy and full Wiggins is as the greatest common denominator for the Warriors' space, defense, and size. So, Cole's arrangement is entirely based on the consideration of the game itself, and there is no other reason? have. This is about a hidden conflict. The team's choice of direction is that Wiggins is absent, balancing space, leading defense, and size. Isn't the most perfect solution not to start Curry, DiVincenzo, Tang Shen, Chasing Dream, and Looney? When the Warriors had a battle with the Grizzlies, DiVincenzo had already proven his worth against the Grizzlies. Cole did not choose this plan, but insisted on Looney as a substitute, which further showed that the inside was stretched tight. Over the years, Cole has rarely complained about the lineup configuration, but this season he will say that he is ""worried about the playing time of Dream Chaser and Looney"", and even stated that Wiseman will not get time when he returns, and Jaglin will In front of him. Of course, Jaglin got time mainly because Wiggins was absent and Kuminga started, which resulted in one less rotation spot in the substitute frontcourt. In fact, after Cole separated Dream Chaser and Looney, he could not give other insiders time. Kerr obviously knows better than anyone how short the Warriors are in the frontcourt, how much pressure there is inside, and how difficult Wiseman is to use. If Looney and Dream Chaser start together, the biggest problem is that unless Looney is beaten hard, the third insider will inevitably need to take part of the rotation time at the fifth position, and neither Wiseman nor Jaglin is worthy of pursuing in a game. Appear in a victorious match. Cole hopes that the management will improve the depth of the 4th and 5th positions. The current tight situation does not allow for any mistakes. Once one of Dream Chaser and Looney suffers a period of injury after the trade deadline, the Warriors may not be able to survive. past. As for Poole, whether he starts or not is not the most important thing. The important thing is that he will steadily take up about 30 minutes of rotation time, but when Curry and Tang Shen are healthy, from a compatibility perspective, his more suitable playing time is within 25 minutes. This time cannot be reduced, which is indeed the result of human nature. Even if there is no explicit or implicit indication of the team's advantage, Poole's attempt to establish himself as one of the team's core seems to have the support or tacit approval of some people with the right to speak in the team. . If Wiseman's problem can be converted from hurting the team to reducing fault tolerance in the form of DNP, then Poole's problem has become the elephant in the room, even if everyone remained a gentleman after the punching incident. , and it is impossible to avoid the impact he brings to the formation and salary distribution. He solved some problems and then became new ones, just like the story of the Warriors and the Dragon: Poole rose up and became the backup for the Splash Brothers, providing rest for the two veterans and assisting the Warriors in winning the 22nd championship. As a new variable, he is the one who solves the problem; but after solving the problem, as a new variable, he breaks the original balance. This variable further expands itself and becomes a new problem. Although Poole fans and Wiggins fans quarrel the most, there is no actual conflict of interest between the two. Wiggins is the undisputed glue. No matter how Poole renews his contract or plays, Wiggins will It's Wiggins. The ones who have the biggest conflict with Poole are the three veterans Ku Chuitang. Due to his personality, compared to Tang Shen, whose positioning overlaps more seriously with Poole, Dream Chasing Club, who is more willing to speak out on behalf of the older generation, will take the lead in attacking. That punch was the climax of the ""green tea"" conflict. It broke the silence and made the future of dream chasing confusing. For both the Warriors and Dream Chasers, there is not enough reason to leave each other, but this requires Dream Chaser to have a solid position as one of the team leaders, ensure that he has a sense of subjectivity as a member of the dynasty, and then contribute to the long-term outside of the game. value. Only mutual respect and recognition can truly achieve a win-win situation, and after that punch, the prospects of this win-win situation moved in a downward direction. Of course, no matter what, you shouldn’t hit people when chasing your dreams. While this punch put him in a passive position, it also made Poole's indulgence more and more uncheckable. The release of the video made Poole gain more sympathy, so reflection became his own business. His flamboyant personality and unrestrained playing style are both provocative and easy to win the support of home fans (compared to the domestic shouting and beating of Poole fans, Poole's popularity in the Bay Area is not low). Poole, who holds a big contract, is even more unscrupulous. . I don't want to say this is a ""mistake"", different people have different acceptance of different personalities. In the Warriors, backcourt players have to take a lot of difficult shots. If they don't have the personality to dare to fight and fight hard, they are like Moody, who ""can't make a fart out of eight poles."" It's hard to get ahead. If Poole doesn't have this character, then he can't play it. The problem is that neither level nor qualifications are enough to support Poole in controlling this personality. This lack of preparation will almost certainly trigger an incident like today. Before one of the standards and qualifications is met, as long as Poole does not restrain himself, just like the fist-pumping incident, this type of conflict will not be the last. This shot is a bad choice for anyone. Looking at the entire league, no matter how brainless a player is, he will not take such a shot in that position, because the history's top scorer next to him, the team boss, Stephen ·Curry is asking for the ball. Even if you are Li Guang, Huang Zhong, Hua Rong, Apollo, Hou Yi, or Sylvanas, you still have to give the ball to Curry. I believe that Curry didn't think too much when he lost his braces. With Curry's generosity, he wouldn't care much about his younger brother's behavior that crossed the line. His outburst was a concentrated release of the emotions that had been accumulated recently, and Poole was just the trigger. However, as long as Curry thinks about it for a moment, he shouldn't regret this move. The team's ambiguous attitude towards the current championship competition, as well as the various signals revealed by Miles' possible departure, were all condensed into four words in Poole's move: It's too much! After the game, Poole hugged Curry, who was waiting for him, in the tunnel. The scars seemed to heal instantly, and the conflict had been blown away by the wind. But before this hug, Poole imitated Curry's throw, which was also an attitude response. Poole's three-point throw threw the team's direction conflict on Curry's face; Curry's braces throw threw his dissatisfaction with the ambiguous attitude on Lacob's face; Poole's buzzer-beating throw threw the The directional conflict that broke out between Curry and Lacob was suppressed; but in the end, Poole's braces dropped, as if to hint that everything would not fundamentally change. At least, you have to accept some established facts. Poole, he's always going to be like this. Confirmation of the main body of the team So, what is the root of the problem? Let me imagine a future scenario: Steve Kerr began to regret that decision, although he still does not understand why Stephen agreed to his suggestion, which made the insomnia the night before the suggestion unnecessary. Stephen's ankle injury, like Kerr's own back injury, haunts him like a ghost, making him write long-term plans with trepidation. So, when Stephen returned from injury again, Cole suggested that he start from the bench first, so as not to destroy the chemical reaction that the team had finally rebuilt. Stephen was silent for about 3 seconds and nodded. He didn't question it, which made Cole a little uneasy, but then Stephen showed the warmest smile in the world, which made the two never tangle on this issue again. After that, until he retires, Curry will play after 6 minutes of the first quarter. Just like the silver-haired old fan who always sits in the third row, he always takes his seat two minutes later than the jump ball time. Kerr understands that compared to Curry, he is nothing special. While recuperating from a back injury, Atkinson strictly implemented the system established by Cole. This strictness even exceeded Cole's own persistence. But in Lacob Jr.'s office, negotiations on contract renewal were not as smooth as the system was running. Cole thought of the agreement Miles made before he left. Somewhere in the league, they left each other not only memories, but also the possibility of joining hands again. Has that time really come? Cole left the office and couldn't help but look back. The younger Lacob sat in his father's chair, Dunleavy lit a cigar for him, and Atkinson kissed his left hand. So Cole smiled. Just like 3 seconds after he told Curry the suggestion, Curry's share. #nba#Jing Yimo’s Lost Island Golden State Warriors",,,,NBA,55,143,992,1/26/23 19:38,Weibo web version,"['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/006BeA6Ely1haha8d31ypj30my0ee788.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006BeA6Ely1haha8dr276j30xc0m846g.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 006BeA6Ely1haha8e0dkfj30xc0gotcf.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/006BeA6Ely1haha8edj33j30zk0k07cm.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006BeA6Ely1haha8fkp9kj31z41b fnpd.jpg']",,
4.86E+15,Mq7aN32xz,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"Lillard scored 60 points today. In this season with frequent records, this probably won't scare anyone, but I have to add: This is the fourth 60-point game in his career. ——Harden scored 60 points in four games. Baylor scored 60 points in four games. Jordan scored 60 points in five games. Kobe scored 60 points in six games. Further up is Chamberlain's 60 points in 32 games, not to mention this. I often say that Lillard is like Arenas of this era - Arenas only had 60 points in one game, the 2006 game against Kobe. Of course, everyone knows that Lillard is good at scoring. 50+ points in a single game, sixth most in history. Looking at records such as 15 points in a single quarter, 18 points in a single quarter, and 20 points in a single quarter, the top three currently in service are him, Curry and Harden. Everyone knows that Lillard is good at long-range three-pointers, and his touch is unstoppable: today is another 9 three-pointers - the number of 9 three-pointers in a single game in NBA history. He is second, and Curry is first. Speaking of Curry, we talked during the preseason. After Lillard returned from injury, he seemed to be a bit Curry-like. The performance is more without the ball, faster shots, and lower take-off. I took over in a hurry today, so it's not too obvious. Lillard is averaging a career-high 11 three-pointers per game this season, and his three-point assist rate is 55%, the highest since 2014. As for the quickness of the shot, there were also wonderful 360-degree three-pointers today, catching the ball around the screen and shooting quickly, etc. But that's not the point: Lillard has always been good at shooting, and he just fine-tuned his basket after returning from injury. Lillard made 12 of 14 two-pointers today. Before today's game, Lillard shot 56% from two-point range, a career high; he averaged 8.4 free throws per game, a career high. To put it another way: Lillard averages more free throws per game this season than the breakthrough monster Morant. Harden's free throw shooting ratio this season is 43%, and Lillard's 43%. Background: There are ten people who have averaged more than 8 free throws per game this season. Except for Lillard, the oldest is 28 years old - Lillard is 32 and a half years old. As you get older and come back from injury, you become more able and bolder to attack? Everyone knows Lillard is an iron man. He played 82 games in each of the first three years of his career and missed a total of 37 games in the first nine years of his career. However, he has had minor problems with his waist, abdomen and legs since 2014, and it was only last season that he decided to give himself a major break. He was not idle. He used to like to eat melon seeds, sushi and fried catfish. He would drink some wine from time to time and go out to restaurants to eat something good. As an aside, this place in Oregon and the city of Portland were, in the words of the Chicago media at the time, such simple laborers. It's easy to breed ambitious people - but the food was good in that place. As for the restaurants... ""The quality and quantity of Portland's restaurants is high...the quality of the ingredients is extremely high, and restaurants in New York and Los Angeles cannot imitate it...the location is convenient, and most of them have contracts with farmers and ranches...traditional America The frantic seasoning that is common in dishes is basically invisible here."" - Haruki Murakami's ""If There Really Was a Time Machine"". But when he was recuperating last year, Lillard often skipped breakfast - drank some smoothie, etc. - and then did strength training after getting up, and then practiced running and speed. During this period, he constantly checked the stability and balance of his core, and then shot. Have a huge meal for lunch, and eat nuts throughout the day. Then trainer Sam Allen told him the best way to protect his core was to box. Confrontation, twisting, and balance are all in it. Back to today’s game. Lillard made 12 of 14 two-pointers, including 9 of 10 from the basket. There were rapid changes of direction after the collision, and there were forced layups against Markkanen. Confrontation and balance. After the game, he said that he usually feels special when he scores 60 points, but this time it felt ""very simple"". He didn't feel that he felt particularly good. It was not a so-called hot game. ——That is, he simply scored 60 points on 29 shots. Maybe this level of confrontation is too easy for him? Maybe it's because, after entering 2023, he is averaging 35 points per game and is already used to it? Last year's rest, hard training, and diet control have paid off. Although the Trail Blazers' record so far in the 2022-23 season is not good, Lillard has made a successful comeback this season - this ""simple 60 points"" is a testimony to his hard work. Another angle. Player A averaged 20 shots, 11 three-pointers and eight free throws per game this season, with a two-point shooting percentage of 56%, a three-point assist rate of 55%, and an average of 30 points per game. Player B averaged 20 shots, 12 three-pointers and five free throws per game this season, with a two-point shooting percentage of 58%, a three-point assist rate of 55%, and an average of 29 points per game. A is Lillard, B is Curry. In the 2019-20 season, Curry was injured and rested for a year. Strength, comeback, scoring champion, Finals MVP Lillard was injured and rested for a year in the 2021-22 season. Strengthen and come back. Averaged 30 points per game this season. 60 points in a single game today. They all came back after injuries, they all trained tirelessly on strength and confrontation, and they all performed at the peak of their careers after their comeback. Curry is the three-point leader in NBA history. Lillard is about to tie Carter for sixth place in history. As I mentioned just now: Curry has the most 9 three-pointers in a single game in NBA history, and Lillard is second. They even have a similarity... In the past ten years, Curry ranked first in three-pointers, and Lillard ranked third. Among all the current shooters, Curry's average three-point shot distance is 26.7 feet, and Lillard's is 26.6 feet - Harden makes more three-pointers than Lillard, but his average three-point range is 25.9 feet. The furthest shooter. The best point guard and long range shooter. Heroes of their respective cities. An explosive point guard as a point guard. A career average of 24.5 points, 4.7 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game, a career average of 24.9 points, 4.2 rebounds and 6.7 assists per game. In the mid-1990s, some media in Portland lamented that their city had ""85%, maybe 90% Jordan."" They are similar in every aspect, but there are just a few differences.

4.86E+15,MpNwudA4U,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Rui Hachimura unveiled the trade market] Transaction content: Lakers send Nunn away, 2023 Bulls second-round pick, 2028 second-round pick (the one with worse picks between Lakers and Wizards), 2029 Lakers second-round pick Sign and get Rui Hachimura from the Wizards. This transaction can be said to have officially kicked off the mid-season trade drama of the 2022-23 season, stirring the hearts of fans of various teams waiting to be strengthened. When the management of the company will take action will become the biggest curiosity when checking the mobile phone before going to bed every day. When it comes to Hachimura, there are always two questions: defensive aggressive data. Hachimura only blocked 24 shots in the first three seasons of his career. For a high-ranking forward who is 2.03 meters tall, this statistic is a bit incredible. His steal numbers are also very average, and his interception rate is very low among players at the same position. Although the risk-taking data is not equivalent to the defensive effect, it is also a side portrait; the offensive end positioning is awkward. Hachimura's main offensive method is the mid-range. He has emergency stop and pull-up skills with both hands. He has turn-back skills in the low post. He can step back with his left foot and make mid-range shots. His long two-pointer is very efficient. His finishing efficiency at the basket is above the standard, but his production is average and he doesn't make many free throws. Apart from this, Hachimura has no strengths on the offensive end. He has no value in passing and controlling. As an option for occasionally punishing mismatches, he cannot be mentioned in too important a position. Hachimura only shot 44.7% of the three-pointers in a small sample last season, and the suspected range expansion has not continued. This season, he took 4.4 three-pointers every 36 minutes, with a 33.7% shooting rate. Combined with his career experience, it shows that Hachimura The village is an unproductive and inefficient three-point shooter. These two common questions about Hachimura actually describe a classic ""four different"" forward model. You don't know how to position such players in the team building plan. If you look to Hachimura as a core player, unless he is playing in low-level games, he does not have the ability to absorb a large amount of the ball in every game. During the rookie contract period, it can still be interpreted as ""growing"". The rookie contract is about to expire. The 24-year-old Hachimura has not shown enough potential as a core star, so the training opportunities he will get in this direction will only be more in the future. few. If you look at it by the standards of a Jigsaw player, he has almost no points added to this talent tree. The three-pointer is ineffective, there is no flexibility to lead the backcourt players, there is only some frontcourt matchup value, and no help defense value, which is far from the standard 3D forward puzzle. It can be said that no matter how it is positioned, Bacun is not good enough. As a high-ranking youngster who is about to expire, there are usually expectations of a moderate premium. Combined with the team's priority to renew Kuzma, these can explain why the Wizards gave up on him. But the above questions are mainly from the perspective of the Wizards. After all, the Lakers have different situations. It is not difficult for the Wizards to convince themselves to give up this season and make plans for the renewal of important frontcourt players and next season. The Lakers obviously have more ideas. Since entering January, the Lakers have 7 wins and 4 losses. They are currently ranked 12th in the Western Conference with 22 wins and 25 losses. However, the Mavericks, fifth in the Western Conference, are only 25 wins and 23 losses. The gap is very small. The threshold for the Western Conference this year is not high. The Lakers are already very good. It’s hard to look ahead now. Waiting for the return of the thick eyebrows, a wave of reinforcements, a wave of All-Star games, and a place in the middle of the playoffs. No one would have believed this goal a month ago, but it is really hard to say now. Therefore, the focus is not on how many shortcomings Bacun has or how difficult it is to locate, but on three questions: Question 1: Can Bacun bring immediate help to the Lakers? able. Nunn and Hachimura are players of different types but similar in nature, and it is difficult to position them. The best version of Nunn is roughly worthy of this evaluation, ""the defense is not too bad and there is some space for holding the ball."" This positioning looks good, but there is a fatal flaw - Nunn has to occupy a No. 1 position, and a normal team should only have one No. 1 player on the field. If this player cannot provide control, If he has the value that a guard should have, but does not have the defensive ability beyond his size, the compatibility will be very poor. To make matters worse, Nunn is not the best version of himself. On a team that doesn't need space to get to the basket, being a productive and inefficient shooter with some development tools is of limited help. When everyone has positioning problems, for the Lakers, who are crowded with defenders, they would rather choose someone who is taller. At least there is room for adjustment and potential to be tapped. Considering that the Lakers have thick eyebrows at the 5th position, and the Lakers' conservative strategy when thick eyebrows are on the court this season, Hachimura's lack of help defense does not matter. On the offensive end, the Lakers are a very special team: on the one hand, the Lakers are short of shooters, and the impact of poor spacing on them can be seen in many games. There is no doubt that the playoffs will further amplify this shortcoming; on the other hand, However, the Lakers achieved top-level efficiency in attacking the basket despite poor space. Although they have always been capable of this in recent years, there is still a special situation this season-they do not make many mistakes. Some of the Lakers' famous tough battles this season, such as 4 turnovers in defeating the Bucks and 2 turnovers in James' 48-point victory over the Rockets, were all games in which the quality of passing and receiving was almost flawless. The Lakers' recent good offensive performance is also inseparable from their low turnover rate in many consecutive games. Why does this happen? Judging from the resumes of James and Westbrook, they both have the characteristics of making a lot of personal mistakes, but they can reduce the team's overall mistakes. They both digest a large amount of the ball and can drive the team's ball-holding core style of play, which greatly reduces the ball. The team's process for developing an offense. At the same time, beside the two of them, the Lakers still have a bunch of puzzle pieces with certain ball-handling skills. Even the center mop can adjust and finish on its own. This configuration feature means that the Lakers usually do not have the situation of ""killing in a round"". . (In fact, the offensive efficiency of the Lakers is basically the same as that of the Warriors, both ranking in the middle of the league. However, the offensive characteristics of these two teams are exactly opposite, including space, shooting, development, and breakthroughs. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. ) What does this have to do with Hachimura? The Lakers are not the kind of team with strict chemical reactions, and there is no need for space shortcomings (because they are all short). In this environment, as long as Hachimura has the means to score - which he does - even if his play style is fragmented, he can complete his goals. Rounds are enough, this team is not that particular. He won't bring much improvement to the Lakers offense, nor will it make it worse. But since he can take on a larger size on the defensive end, this is a real improvement. Question 2: How does Hachimura renew his contract? The Lakers will also have this problem that worries the Wizards. For the Lakers, how to renew Hachimura's contract depends on his performance in the second half of the season. If Hachimura's performance is okay, he won't have to pick a young striker in the third round. But what if Hachimura plays poorly? If the contract is not renewed, wouldn't the three second rounds be wasted? If I renew my contract, will there be a premium? How to renew Hachimura's contract during the vacation is definitely a problem, but before we imagine the worst outcome, let's think about it first, what did the Lakers pay? The three second rounds are not the first round. The Lakers have not used their core chips and their ability to continue making transactions in the future is limited. In other words, the Lakers may lose money, but they have retained their capital and there will be no unacceptable results. But the cost of three second rounds is not low. If Hachimura is not replaced in three second rounds, who can they replace? Realistically speaking, there are 2 to 3 second rounds on the market, and the level of strikers who can ask for price is not high. The difference between Reddish, Bazley and Hachimura is just chaos evil, neutral evil and order evil. There are two guys that I'm going to look at at where they were last traded: One is Jaylen McDaniels. Since he is a fourth-year second-round pick, he will become an unrestricted free agent during the off period, which will hurt his trade price. The Lakers' bargaining chip has the opportunity to talk to him; the other is Crowder. His level is undoubtedly higher than Hachimura, and the Suns' psychological price should be protected in the first round. However, his age, expired contract status, unstable status, and business attributes will all affect the transaction price. The possibility of falling into the first round, second round swap, or even multiple second rounds is very high. The Suns will give priority to putting Crowder in an upward trade package, so he may not be pursued by the Lakers now. But there is a possibility that Crowder's final trading price is lower than three second rounds. Since this deal does not involve the first round, it only uses Nunn, the overflow asset with a moderate contract amount, and Hachimura is an expiring restricted free agent, so the initiative is in the hands of the Lakers. A lottery with a small loss, which is generally fair. Question 3: What to do next? This is probably the bigger impact part. The management has launched a reinforcement process. Does it show James and the fans that we are not completely flat and are trying to save this season? Or does it mean that the Lakers will make follow-up actions? I'm beginning to think that the probability of the Lakers making follow-up moves has increased. Three second rounds are not assets that can be ignored, and Hachimura is not a player who will inevitably maintain his value. Now that the Lakers have taken this step, it shows that they are not completely looking to the future and their confidence in this season has increased. Recent results, James' state, and the performance of Westbrook, Mob and others are all constantly promoting the management's determination to operate. More importantly, whether it is a starting salary extension or bird rights, Hachimura will eat up a lot of space. The space that the Lakers can clear this summer will be much reduced, which means that their ability to make reinforcements from the free market will be reduced. . Free market reinforcements are generally based on this principle: if you have the ability to offer a maximum salary or close to the maximum salary, it is very important to clear the space, because getting superstars from the free market is often the most cost-effective reinforcement. The embarrassing part is that the Lakers have tried their best to clear out the maximum salary of about 25% of the salary cap, which is the level of the first maximum salary at the end of the rookie contract. Once these players are on bonus contracts, they will inevitably They will be matched by the parent team and kept in the team, and those who can be released are at a level between worthy and unworthy. Therefore, the significance of the Lakers filling up space is a question mark, unless a superstar joins with a salary cut. The superstars will form a tacit understanding in advance if they join forces. If anyone is willing to come, the Lakers should generally know by now; if they can only clear about 10 million of space, the meaning will be limited. Because you can't sign players who are better than the full mid-level players; if you can open up more than 10 million and less than 30 million of space, for the playoff teams, the greater significance is to broaden the selection list so that they can Take ownership of some of the top puzzles. For example, when talking about players like Dream Chasing and Kuzma in the free market, you don’t need to be controlled by others. The advantage of this method is to save draft picks, but the disadvantage is that it needs to give up some players who can be renewed with bird rights. The total salary that can be used will be lower than the method of becoming a cap-top team and using the entire mid-level team, which makes the team's actual combat strength No improvement is seen. Therefore, after the Blazers cleared space last year, the final method they chose was not to rely purely on space to sign people, but to take a middle road. This is most likely the case for the Lakers. In other words, the Lakers' thinking is probably that they don't necessarily have to wait until the vacation to use space to solve the problem. Then, if there is a suitable candidate now, whether to take action just depends on whether the cost is acceptable. There are some suitable candidates on the market, such as Bo Yang, but what remains unsolved is how to get the draft picks. There are a lot of teams at a crossroads, whose goals are not entirely certain and will continue to lurch left or right as the season progresses. In order for the management to strengthen their confidence and work in a direction more conducive to the current situation, the best way is undoubtedly for the team to show an exciting performance and let the management see the hope of winning in the present. James and the Lakers have done this in the past month or so. They have recovered from the dead situation without thick eyebrows. Of course, thick eyebrows have chosen conservative treatment in order to retain hope for this season and the Lakers will be able to persevere. premise. In comparison, the next door will be more tangled. Winning means two tracks running smoothly in parallel, without the need for reinforcement. Losing means losing hope for the championship, so we must keep the fire. Perhaps only the reason of not being able to enter the playoffs and resulting in high investment losses can make the boss make up his mind. But when this happens, there is also a possibility that investment in the next season will drop sharply and completely enter the future mode. This chess move is arranged so that you have no temper at all.

4.86E+15,MpJX3jWvi,1641501402,Panhai,"On the 97th day of the NBA season, the Los Angeles Lakers took the lead in pulling the trigger on the trade. They sent guard Kendrick Nunn and three second-round picks to acquire Japanese forward 8-inch base from the Washington Wizards. At this point, the league has finally seen its first player transaction of a reinforcing nature this season (previously, the Celtics traded Noah Vonleh to the Spurs on January 5, but was subsequently waived by the Spurs) . The Lakers got Hachimura, and the improvement is very significant. Hachimura has a height of 2.03 meters, a wingspan of 2.18 meters, and can play the third and fourth positions. His physical hardware is something that the Lakers' current rotating forwards do not have. of. In addition, Hachimura has good shooting ability. According to reports, Hachimura only made 33.7% of his three-pointers this season. However, looking at the breakdown, he is a three-point shooter who needs sufficient preparation time. In the past two seasons, Hachimura's ""wide-open"" three-point shooting rate (more than 6 feet away from the defender) has reached 45.6% and 42.0% respectively. The Lakers' wide-open three-point shooting rate this season is only 35.1%, fourth in the league. , the team's highest is Lonnie Walker's 40.9%, which is still lower than Hachimura. Hachimura's season three-point shooting percentage was hampered by the fact that the Wizards' ability to create wide open spaces was only fifth in the league. With James and Westbrook, the Lakers ranked in the middle of the league in this area. At the same time, Hachimura has had excellent mid-range shooting ability since Gonzaga University. This season, his shooting rate has reached an elite level of 49.3%. He has a great opportunity to enrich the Lakers' offensive distribution, and he also has the ability in the restricted area. More than 72% success rate. In theory, the eight-inch base can directly replace Troy Brown as the Lakers' starting small forward, but it would be fine if Lonnie Walker continues to start after recovering from injury. Hachimura has been playing as a substitute for the Wizards this season and still averages per game. With a 13-point contribution, he just scored 30 points for the second time this season as a bench. Another important point is that if he appears as a substitute with Westbrook, it will help Hachimura quickly enter the state. The two had a very good understanding in the 2020-21 season, when Westbrook regained the MVP status after the All-Stars. His level of energy brought the Wizards into the playoffs. Hachimura was his favorite passing target during that period. Westbrook assisted Hachimura 87 times after the All-Star Game, which was the highest among all Wizards teammates in the same period, even surpassing Blazers. Deli Beale. Hachimura said in an interview at the time that Westbrook once specifically approached each of them during the season and asked them what position they like to play in and how they like to catch the ball. Because they signed with the same sponsorship brand, the two of them There have been interactions, so Westbrook became Hachimura's mentor during the Wizards period. Hachimura told the American media that he had called Westbrook ""Senpai"". Friends who read Japanese comics will naturally understand what it means. For the Lakers, Walker and Rivers are about to return. There is no need to feel sorry for Nunn's recent performance. They also maintained their bottom line of not giving away the two first-round picks in 2027 and 2029 easily, and completed it with three second-round picks. The reinforcements also allowed Hachimura to escape the ""not strong, but inward"" environment in the Wizards. The Wizards will leave time for Kuzma, Avdija and Kispert on the front line. From a timeline perspective, the Lakers also completed their signings at a suitable time. First of all, they have recently shown quite good combat effectiveness, which is completely different from their appearance at the beginning of the season. Making signings at this time is expected to boost military morale. Secondly, Nongmei’s injury recovery has improved significantly. He has recently conducted full strength training with healthy players. His return and the return of the two injured backcourt players have been put on the agenda. On the basis of a complete lineup, With a little help, the timing is naturally perfect. The Lakers are currently ranked 12th in the Western Conference, but due to the chaotic situation this season, they are only 2.5 games behind the Mavericks, who are fifth in the Western Conference. With the current progress of the season, there is still a lot to be done to catch up with such a slim gap.",,,,,11,66,378,1/24/23 8:14,iPhone client that hasn’t worn out yet,['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/61d752daly1haef9d8xunj20sg0iz405.jpg'],,

4.94E+15,Nfp6xdAOx,2811909440,Memories of those years,"#体育##NBA# The NBA offseason has passed halfway, and every team is preparing for the new season, and some of them are still looking to make some transactions to optimize their lineup and salary structure. According to The Athletic reporter Fred Katz, the New York Knicks are one of them. They have discussed the possibility of trading Immanuel Quickley this summer, and the Los Angeles Lakers are their potential trade destination. Quickley is a young and promising guard who was selected by the Thunder with the 25th overall pick in the first round of the 2020 NBA Draft and was subsequently traded to the Knicks. He is a lethal shooter. He performed well at the University of Kentucky in college, averaging 16.1 points, 4.2 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game, and his three-point shooting percentage was as high as 44.7%. He also showed great strength in his first season in the NBA, averaging 11.4 points, 2.1 rebounds and 2 assists per game, shooting 39.5% from the field and 38.9% from three-point range. He was selected to the second team of the All-Rookie Team. Quickley's technical advantages include shooting ability, athletic ability, organizational ability and defensive ability. He is an excellent shooter who can create and exploit shooting opportunities from the outside, as well as drive to the layup and pass. He is a dynamic athlete who can run and jump as well as steal and block shots. He is a potential organizer who can control the rhythm and direction of the game, and can also cooperate and communicate with his teammates. He is a responsible defender who is able to comply with the coach's tactical arrangements and requirements, and is also able to adapt to the opponent's offensive style. Quickley is suitable for joining a team that lacks outside shooting, and the Lakers need his long-range shooting skills to supplement the team's deficiencies. The Lakers shot only 35.4% from three-point range last season, ranking 21st in the league. Moreover, the Lakers lost several important outside shooters during the offseason, such as Pope, Caruso, Matthews, etc. Although the Lakers have introduced new players such as Noel, Ellington, and Monk to enhance their outside firepower, they are not as young and stable as Quickley. If Quickley joins the Lakers, he can provide James and Davis with more space and options, creating threats and pressure from the outside. Quickley's young blood is also in line with the Lakers' long-term considerations for future development. The Lakers' current core players are all over 30 years old and all have a history of injuries. The Lakers need to introduce some young and promising players to ensure the team's competitiveness and sustainability. Quickley is only 21 years old and still has a lot of room for growth and potential. He can learn and improve with the Lakers and become the future pillar of the team. The Lakers are reportedly willing to match the Knicks' trade offer and trade a future first-round pick for Quickley. This deal will officially bring the Lakers' roster to 14 people and will take effect when the new season begins. This is a good deal for the Lakers. They can exchange an uncertain draft pick for a certain player, and it is also a player that meets the team's needs and future plans. If Quickley joins the Lakers, he is expected to become an immediate asset for the team. He can compete with Noel, Ellington, Monk and others for playing time in the backcourt, and may even become a starter or sixth man. He can provide the team with stable scoring and passing on the offensive end, and can also cause trouble and trouble to opponents on the defensive end. However, he also needs to gain weight, improve strength and offensive efficiency to perform better in the NBA. He also needs to adapt to the Lakers' tactical system and cultural atmosphere, and establish tacit understanding and trust with his teammates.",,,,"sports, NBA",0,0,0,8/20/23 7:31,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hgzwwcsg03j20j80enq4w.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hgzwwcrprzj20k50hk774.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 7ea3385dly1hgzwwcrhc4j20jx0i00v2.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hgzwwcs6mcj20jx0i00v2.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hgzwwcs q8bj20kh0eljtk.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg. cn/large/7ea3385dly1hgzwwcsx1oj20ix0hngoc.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hgzwwcuhy0j20jk0et0ui.jpg']",,

The rivalry between the Suns and the Warriors is also a story-telling matchup. Both teams are strong teams in the Western Conference. It goes without saying that the intensity of their confrontation is natural, but because of Paul, this will inevitably attract more attention. What kind of game Paul will play against his old team, the Solar, and how he can better coexist with Curry in the Warriors will all be topics of discussion that will last for a season. According to statistics, the Warriors and Lakers will be the two teams with the most live broadcasts in the United States in the new season, with 41 and 40 games respectively. It can be seen that the two teams are still top-notch. The biggest change of the Warriors in the offseason was the departure of Poole and the introduction of Paul. The Warriors still retained the main team that won the championship that year. They will also try again towards the championship in the new season. The Lakers also retained their main lineup during the offseason. They successfully renewed the contracts of Rui Hachimura, Rivers, and Russell, and also renewed the contract of Deng Mei in advance. In addition, they introduced shooter Vincent, and the Lakers' lineup Their strength has further improved, and they have also set their sights on the championship. However, the Warriors and Lakers have tough schedules in the new season. They each have 15 back-to-back games. The Warriors also had seven consecutive away games once, and the Lakers had six consecutive away games twice. The Spurs, who ranked last last season, also attracted much attention due to the addition of talented young man Bunyama Yama. Bunyama has super talent, but it is still unknown what level of competition he can play in the NBA. But no matter what, the Spurs with Wenbanyama will also become a focus team in the league.

From the 10th place team in the regular season, they ""overcame the obstacles"" and went on to the final wave of 3 consecutive games. The victory ended strongly and won the eighth spot in the Class A East.

The 27VS46 Telecommunications Cybercrime Investigation Brigade of the High-tech Development Zone Police Station entered the ""playoffs"". Each team showed more enthusiasm for participating and a higher level of competition. In particular, the Telecom Cybercrime Investigation Team reasonably resolved conflicts between work and competition, and for the first time in the playoffs, all members of the team competed together. At the beginning of the game, the Telecom Cyber Crime Investigation Team showed its strong strength in the last championship. Liu Hui, the star of the Telecom Cyber Crime Investigation Team, took the initiative to confront Ma Chen, a powerful insider in the High-tech Development Zone, and played a very good limiting role. High-tech Development The district police station did not give in too much, especially in the cheerleading of the team’s cheerleading team, who clung to the score. The second quarter of the game ushered in a dramatic scene. The Telecom Cybercrime Investigation Team led by 6 points. The team members suddenly fell into a state of slackness and failed to enter the High-tech Development Zone Police Station three times in a row. They seized the opportunity and closed the point difference to 3 points before halftime. . During the halftime break, Liu Hui went berserk on the spot: ""Rookies, wake up, this is the playoffs!""

As the ""second police officer in the millennium"", Jiuzhou Police Station also regards this season as a ""battle of destiny"" to change its destiny, and organizes a three-kilometer run every day after work for all employees. After the game started, the Jiuzhou Police Station changed its old tradition of positional defense and adopted the NBA's full-court marking style.

4.94E+15,Nf65NqQSM,1740825602,I am like fire,"#体育##NBA# 1. The most stable outside shooter on the offensive end and the creator of the team’s offensive space. In the current era of small ball trends, offensive space is what every team dreams of. Just like another Texas team, they directly gave up the traditional center in pursuit of the ultimate space. The Mavericks have obviously done better at this point. The team has a tall player Porzingis who fully meets the needs of the times. For him, it is better to shoot accurately from outside the three-point line than to fight inside. In the series against the Clippers, Porzingis also used his shooting ability many times to hit open shots when the opponent's center could not cover up in time. For the Mavericks, it is precisely because of the threat of Boshen on the outside that the team seems to have the ultimate offensive space on the court. Therefore, in the first three games, we can see that whether it is Hardaway or Burke, This type of player who prefers breakthroughs obviously performs better. This is because the presence of Porzingis prevents the opponent's center from shrinking inside. Therefore, once the opponent's first line of defense is broken through, the rest is almost smooth sailing. In the three playoff games he participated in, Porzingis averaged 31.3 minutes per game, scoring 23.7 points and 8.7 rebounds, close to a double-double. This is not bad for Porzingis, who entered the playoffs for the first time. good. Although the scoring average does not exceed 25 points per game, it cannot be denied that Boshen is an important help to the team on the offensive end, especially in the offensive space. In G4 and G5 in the absence of Boshen, although the Mavericks won one of them, we can clearly see that the Clippers can boldly shrink the basket when facing Doncic, or When Doncic broke through the first defender, other players immediately covered the inside in time. This is because without Boshen, the Mavericks' offensive space became narrower. After all, other players present did not have Boshen. external threats. As a big man with a height of 2.21m, Porzingis has a soft touch like a guard. Especially when shooting three-pointers, you can even see a little bit of Nowitzki. He is a veritable high-powered fortress. . In the first five games, Porzingis is the player with the highest three-point shooting percentage on the team. Under the higher intensity of defense in the playoffs, Porzingis' offensive efficiency has improved overall. From the picture above, we can see that Porzingis’ overall shooting rate in the playoffs was as high as 53%, and his three-point shooting rate was an astonishing 52.9%. That is, after Porzingis made a three-pointer, there were With more than half the probability of scoring 3 points, this kind of offensive efficiency is really scary. It can be said that in the face of the Clippers' weak interior defense, Porzingis is the Mavericks' most stable scoring point, even surpassing Luka Doncic at this point. Because once the Clippers double-team Doncic, Doncic's efficiency will inevitably drop, and for Porridge, the Clippers really have no players who can form an effective defense against him. 2. The defense is not too bad. Boshen is still a master of frame protection for the Mavericks. Most fans have this understanding of European players, that is, the defense of European players is not strong, especially the inside players. Whether it is Pau Gasol or Marc Gasol, what is more outstanding is their gorgeous inside offensive skills. In fact, the same is true for Porzingis. Compared to his near-perfect performance on the offensive end, Boshen's performance on the defensive end can only be considered average, but when it comes to poor defense, Boshen is definitely not in this category. After all, he only relies on his height of 2.21 meters to have enough ability in the paint. Defensive threat. What's more, among the big players, Boshen also has very strong mobility. It can be said that in the current Mavericks lineup, it is really difficult to find a better frame protector than Boshen. In fact, even from a high-level perspective, Boshen's defense is definitely not as bad as fans said. Although in the playoff game against the Clippers, Boshen's defensive efficiency of 117.6 is indeed not high, but if you look at it from a regular perspective Judging from the game's data of 107.0, Boshen's defense is definitely enough for the Mavericks. After all, for the Mavericks, offense is their only weapon to win the game. On the other hand, when facing the Clippers with a top lineup, any outstanding defender may be defeated. After all, the Clippers With two superstars. 3. Scoring is also explosive, and there is still a long way to go before becoming a top player. Judging from the games played in the playoffs, Porzingis not only has a stable offensive performance, but also has excellent scoring explosiveness. This is different from the Kuaishou. This was fully reflected in the ship's G3. In the G3 game, Porzingis scored 11 points in a single quarter and a double-double of 34 points and 13 rebounds. It can be said that Porzingis is a lone ranger. An indispensable and important core. In fact, from the perspective of playing style and role, Porzingis is very similar to Anthony Davis in the Lakers, but for him, there is a clear gap between him and Davis in terms of strength. From the above comparison, it is not difficult to find that Brother Big Eyebrow's performance in the playoffs this season is almost impeccable, almost crushing Porzingis in terms of statistics. But this is relatively normal. After all, thick eyebrows have already entered the ranks of superstars. What they don't need to prove is whether they are considered superstars. For Porzingis, he can only be regarded as a first-class player and may not even be a star, so this comparison is obviously unfair. But judging from the comparison of data, the gap behind Porzingis is actually not big. For him, who is participating in the playoffs for the first time, this performance can really explain to the fans. After all, the growth of any player comes at the cost of time and record, so why can't we give Porzingis more time and look forward to his further growth? After the Mavericks lost to the Clippers in this game, fans finally realized that in the absence of Porzingis, once the Clippers tried their best to strangle Doncic, the Mavericks would be completely out of ideas on the court. On the defensive end, after losing the platinum, Harrell was obviously liberated. He also got a double-double of 19+11 in this game. It can be said that Boshen's injury has caused the Mavericks' internal defensive intensity to drop significantly. From today's disastrous defeat, we can also find that although Porzingis is not a top superstar, he can still have the ability to influence the outcome of the game. It can be said that if Porzingis is still absent in the G6 game, then the Mavericks may be in trouble.

It is rare to see a 1v1 that can pass the defensive player, so a spoon like Zidane's A penalty kick and Lillard's winning three-pointer will go down in history. That kind of game compares basic qualities, who has better physical strength, who can dribble well, and who can stop the ball well. The ultimate goal of basketball is to shoot the ball. If you don't have Irving's dribbling talent, or you don't have Curry's three-point accuracy, it doesn't matter. You just need to make open shots, and if you make mid-range shots, you will be a star. You don’t need to listen to the media people saying how talented Cui x Sun x and so on are. They can’t even make a shot in the international arena. If you score 10 points, you are the superstar of the team. NBA substitute level, 10 points, you make a foul , 4 mid-range shots are enough. You will definitely have 4 mid-range opportunities in a game. Now the Chinese team is called ineffective passing ball, and they can only hang inside and shoot three-pointers. If those players who claim to be shooters take a step forward, won't the tactics be viable? A big gap appears and the opportunity comes to you. Do you dare to shoot?

4.93E+15,NeF5vb3Tx,7508028520,Basketball teaching from Wang’s perspective,"It refers to the scoring method of shooting in a restricted area. Each shot is worth one point. The restricted area consists of a free throw line and a semicircle. The free throw line is 5.8 meters away from the bottom line of the basketball court. Free throws are often the key to basketball games, especially when the score difference between the two teams is close at the last minute. Since free throws are not allowed to interfere with other players, the free throw shooting percentage is generally high, around 60% to 80%, and shooters such as Reggie Miller, Steve Nash, Stephen Curry, etc. can even exceed 90%; Of course, there are also post players like Wilt Chamberlain, Shaquille O'Neal, and Howard whose free throw percentage is less than 60%, which means that free throws cost nearly half as many points as ordinary shots. So some teams take advantage of this to deliberately compare free throws. Bad players commit fouls to keep up the score. So free throws are the easiest and hardest, even for NBA stars.

Because of my limited ability, although the update is not fast enough, I will listen to everyone's criticisms and corrections humbly. Thank you.

4.93E+15,NepfXbg5V,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"Tony Parker, 2023 Hall of Fame class. In terms of position, he seems to be inferior to his peers Wade, Dirk and Gasol. But if you list it in one column...2007 Finals MVP. The 2013 Western Conference champion team led the regular season and playoffs in scoring + assists. The regular season and playoff scoring + assists leaders of the 2014 championship team (although he was not the Finals MVP, he was the Spurs' scoring and assists leader in the 2014 Finals). Six-time All-Star. Sixth in total playoff appearances in history. The 11th highest total playoff points in history - Curry is 12th and Wade is 13th. 11th in total field goals made in the postseason in history - 12th in Big Dream. When these records are laid out, people will sigh: ""What a legend!"" But when it falls on Tony Parker, people - especially Spurs fans - will probably think: ""Really? So many historical records, Comes from the sweet-smiling little Parker we know?"" Probably because we are used to Duncan's calmness, to Ginobili's eagerness and eccentricity, and to Parker's baby-faced look even when he is serious - whatever. I don’t think he is a historical legend. Outside of the Spurs, few people will notice: Although he won the Finals MVP and three championships at the age of 25, Parker's career peak actually only started when he was 30 years old. He made the second team of three leagues between the ages of 30 and 32, and was fifth, sixth and twelfth in MVP votes. It is not wrong to say that he was a late bloomer like Nash (of course not as outstanding as Nash). The 2013 Western Conference semifinals between the Spurs and the Warriors now seems to be the famous playoff battle between Curry and Klay, but only in the summer of 2013, Parker may have a greater position than Curry: after all, he was the second-team defender in the league at that time Well! Sound magical? Although he made the second team three times, Parker probably never became an outstanding point guard in people's minds. Since joining the industry, he has faced off against Kidd, Billups, Nash, Paul, Deron, Westbrook, Lillard, and Curry. It seems like everyone is bigger than him. But he took four rings. Fall 2008. The Spurs' injury wave crippled their lineup, so he scored 133 points in the first four games of the season and 55 points in Minnesota. In the spring of 2009, he used 37 points, 39 points, and 42 points to drag the Spurs through the muddiest injury swamp. Of course, who will remember - not even Spurs fans - on March 25, 2009, Parker scored 42 points and 10 assists at home in Atlanta. Then, he returned to the system and continued to play Spurs-style basketball for ten years as his French sports car. Of course he is not perfect, but on the other hand, would Kidd, Wall or Lillard really be more suitable for the Spurs system than Parker? We'll never know. He collided with Dirk more often in the NBA. But in FIBA, especially in Europe, he was once Gasol's opponent. In the 2007 European Championship, Parker ranked second in scoring, second only to Dirk, and higher than Turkoglu, Gasol and AK47. In the 2009 European Championship, he still ranked second in scoring, second only to Gasol. In the 2011 European Championship, he was the scoring champion and the best team, leading France to the final but losing to Spain. In the 2013 European Championship, Parker led France to win the championship and was the scoring champion and MVP. That was the most glorious moment in the history of French basketball. That was also the only European champion that did not belong to Spain (Gasol brothers) from 2009 to 2015. To most NBA fans, that doesn't seem like a big deal: after all, European champions are relatively niche and not as eye-catching as Ginobili's Olympic champion in 2004. He is a king-level presence who changed the landscape of European basketball. But for a long time in San Antonio, he had big eyes, Duncan touched his head, Popovich lectured him, and he smiled sweetly. There are many things off the field that make people think he is immature, but looking back unknowingly... he has accumulated a lot of historical achievements. There seemed to be many better options than him, but in the end, he was the only one who contributed so much to the Spurs -- aside from what John Stockton did for the Jazz, no point guard should have done more for any single player in NBA history. A team that has done more and longer. Probably the same as Duncan and Ginobili, because it lasted so long and was so stable that we took everything for granted. It wasn't until he retired that he looked back and realized: He's a true legend for other people; for the Spurs themselves, well, it seems, they just have a lot of problems with their own family, but after looking at it for a long time, he got used to it, and when he suddenly left, he found that he still had a lot of problems. An irreplaceable little boy... Steve Nash once said that he is not so much fast as he is agility and balance - that is where his agility lies. As his old rival, Parker could also be described as such. Parker has a lot of problems: his defense is mediocre, he only had a long-range shot from the corner in his later years, he has never been a master of playmaking, and so on. In 2000, when Buford manager gave Popovich a tape and asked him to see the kid who was ""born in Belgium and raised in France,"" Popovich said: ""Belgium? I want to eat waffles."" ""?"" - ""Everyone knows, don't look for guards in Europe! They are not fast enough, and they are not used to the NBA! If you give me a shooter with vie at the end of his name, or Dirk's German neighbor, I will watch!"" Before Parker arrived, the Spurs were not a team that everyone liked to watch. There are two towers on the inside, and on the outside there are veteran shooters such as Little General, Elie, and Daniels. The beating was slow and boring, like black iron. Parker is a ray of bright silver on this black iron: he will make mistakes, miss his teammates, and fail to make three-pointers, but he can run and make layups easily. In his first two years in the industry, Parker was often scolded by Popovich: No wonder, after all, the Spurs backcourt was full of old men in their 30s, and he was the only one under 20. At the same time, Parker remained diligent and studious. He was not afraid of the old man's scolding, and would often run back and ask the coach: ""Did I do something wrong again?"" At that time, he was not very good at shooting, and his free throws were average. As a sophomore, he found his little shot. This year he became a championship guard and the second scorer on the 2003 championship team. In 2002, Terry Porter said that Parker ""plays the pick-and-roll very well, knows when to push the tempo, when to slow down, and knows how to pass the ball to the Twin Towers. This kid must have watched a lot of NBA when he was in France."" David ·Robinson said that he was ""not nervous at all, just playing. The last rookie like this? Duncan."" In the fifth grade, he was 24 years old, averaging 19 points and 6 assists per game and becoming the Spurs' top scorer in the regular season. His shooting percentage was terrible. 55%. Since this year, his mid-range has almost no blind spots. Coach Chip Englander taught him how to shoot like this: ""I found that his throwing touch was unparalleled, so I tried to teach him to use the throwing technique to make mid-range shots - just with a slight change in posture."" 2006, In 2009 and 2011-14, he was the Spurs' scoring champion. 2006, 2012, and 2014 were the second, third, and fourth seasons with the Spurs' winning percentage in history, and 2011 ranked seventh in winning percentage. In four of the top seven seasons in the Spurs' history, Parker led the team in scoring. Parker's inside presence is not as good as Duncan's, and his passing instigation is not as good as Ginobili's, but from 2008-14, he was the Spurs' best single player with the ball. His balanced breakthrough with both hands, his historically top steps around screens, his turns and counterattacks, and his mid-range shots around screens. The wonderful thing is that from 2010 to 2014, he was still gradually evolving: dribbling, ground passes, layups, medium and long shots, and long passes. And, not everyone may remember: In the first game of the 2013 Finals, he hit the winning goal for the Spurs in a one-on-one. He doesn't have many three-pointers, but he never tries anything he's not good at. He doesn't post up and shoot three-pointers. He also basically doesn't try to force overtake or rush in a straight line. He doesn't race with anyone. Tony Parker is sharp. When he plays one-on-one with the ball, he always attacks with his opponent's front foot. He will not follow the path given by his opponent to break through, but will always force his opponent to turn around. He will straighten up and make an emergency stop to clearly see the opponent's position, and then make an inout or a change of direction. The amplitude does not need to be large, but it is smooth and fast. He can point his hands, eyes, knees and legs in different directions during a hop, like the front wheel of a bicycle turning. He is not the fastest, but with a low center of gravity, he can maintain a strange balance: control of the core strength of his waist and abdomen to ensure his coordination. Other cars may have to fly into the air and forcefully drift when cornering, but this car is just a quick turner. On the other hand, Parker (and Ginobili) can both find space. Ginobili uses his huge strides, while Parker uses small changes of direction and emergency stops. If Ginobili is the type who often rides with his head down, scraping and sprinting, Parker is the type who has a sideways attitude. Ginobili's pursuit is to ""hang you one position above you to shoot"", but Parker is to ""go around you and go to the other side for a layup."" What Ginobili is good at is the European step, which can drastically change directions and swing past people, but Parker is unpredictable: jumping, stepping, and turning. His organizational destructive power is certainly not as good as Westbrook, Harden and Wall, but he doesn't hold the ball as much as these guys. He rarely steps on the gas pedal. He kept riding his bicycle through the crowds and played more than 1,200 regular season games. The only players of his size who have played more games than him are John Stockton, Mark Jackson and Chairman Fish. Looking at it in the long run, Parker’s years with the Spurs from 2001 to 2018... NBA single two-pointers are successful: LeBron has 12,522 points in 44,000 minutes, and Kobe has 10,456 points in 38,000 minutes. Third is Tony Parker with 10,306 points in 37,000 minutes, followed by Wade with 10,202 points. In the past 18 years, only four players in the NBA have scored more than 10,000 points in singles, and Parker can be listed with LeBron, Kobe and Wade. In terms of playoff points during the same period, Parker was fourth, followed by LeBron, Kobe and Duncan. Here comes the funniest thing: He is the third-leading scorer under the basket during the same period, second only to LeBron and Duncan. He is the second person in the same period to succeed in mid-range shots, second only to Kobe - long mid-range shots in the playoffs. Kobe shot 41% and Parker 40%. The Hamilton we are all familiar with, 38%. Yes, a 188-centimeter French small guard, whose vision is not very wide, his organization is not strong, and he does not have a three-pointer. He scores by holding the ball - driving to the basket, making emergency stops for mid-range shots - standing tall and getting four points. A ring. Although he was at the peak of his career from 2011-14, few people pointed out: ""Hey, he is the scoring leader + assist leader on a 60-win championship team!"" He does not steal the limelight. Parker became the team's scoring champion and All-Star in 2006. After becoming the Finals MVP in 2007, he still didn't mind becoming the team's third-leading attacker (behind sixth man Ginobili) two years later. His salary was 9.45 million the year he won the Finals MVP. The highest annual salary was 15.45 million in his last year with the Spurs - his junior Conley's salary that year was 28.53 million. He had many shortcomings, but those shortcomings did not prevent him from winning four championships for the Spurs. After he left the Spurs, he told Mark Spears: During his 17 years with the Spurs, at the beginning of every season, he believed that the Spurs had a chance to win the championship. So after he went to the Hornets, although he was well treated, ""it felt very strange. Every day I play basketball is to win. In the French national team, we fight for the gold medal; in the Spurs, we fight to win. If we can't win the championship And fight, so why compete?"" He has many shortcomings, but he really just wants to win. So Popovich let him play with the Spurs for so long. Foreign players can rely on their height and skills to gain a foothold in the NBA: we have Yao Ming, Dazhi, Battelle, Yi Jianlian, Zhou Qi... Spain has two Gasols, Germany has Dirk, and France has Gobert and Wenban Yama. . But how difficult is it for a foreign guard without the height advantage to be in the NBA? Just think about how difficult it is for Navarro, Yaskovicius, Spanoulis, Rubio and Arroyo. There are four European Finals MVPs in NBA history: Parker, Dirk, Giannis, and Jokic. Parker was the first and only point guard. Since Parker won the Finals MVP in 2007, only one No. 1 player has won the Finals MVP: Curry in 2022. Foreign player, point guard, four championship rings, 2007 Finals MVP. The only foreign point guard in history to win the Finals MVP. Tony Parker. Although he always has a baby face and a relaxed smile, he has spanned a long time and overcome many unimaginable obstacles. is a true legend. Coach Popovich, at the 2023 Hall of Fame ceremony, jokingly mentioned the Spurs' Hall of Fame players. The general was obedient and didn't mention it. Said Parker: ""I asked him to be perfect and was very strict with him. Now, if I treat him like that, I will be arrested."" Said Duncan, ""I just hope that he can nod to me occasionally to show that he heard what I said, which makes me feel a little satisfied."" Speaking of Ginobili, ""Manu came over and said to me: 'I am Manu, and this is how I play!' So I thought it was better to shut up and let him play freely!"" The joke was over, Popovich Said: All the ups and downs of victory and defeat (the four-digit games, four championships, and more than ten years between them together) will pass. Only their experiences, feelings and relationships will always be there. #Parker was elected to the Hall of Fame##2023nba Hall of Fame## Spurs#",,,,"Parker is inducted into the Hall of Fame, 2023nba Hall of Fame, Spurs",100,66,586,8/13/23 18:03,Weibo web version,"['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hgv9v26jwqj30d607emxj.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hgv9v1yk4sj30hn0brgn5.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/ 005ztwqOgy1hgv9v1wryej30d609a74g.jpg']",,

4.93E+15,Ne7Fl7XvL,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Guys who are secretly great, or not great (18)] Hart renewed his contract in advance for 81 million in 4 years. The amount and even the number of years of this early contract extension can be guessed: Hart previously exercised his 13 million player option, and it is not difficult for him to obtain an annual salary greater than this number in the market this summer; if Hart does not jump out, This shows that the Knicks have prepared an attractive enough early contract extension; the new version of the labor agreement allows the starting salary of early renewal to reach 140% of the last year's salary of the previous contract, which means that Hart can earn 18.2 million The starting salary is in line with his real market price; but this money will not be available until the 24-25 season. The execution option is equivalent to Hart giving up profits in the 23-24 season, so the Knicks need to compensate in terms of years and gave Hart a 4-year contract. The total price of 81 million is also the most money Hart can get according to the rules. The benefit for the Knicks is that they do not need to increase the salary bill for the 23-24 season, and can sign DiVincenzo with a full mid-level contract. As DiVincenzo's old teammate, Hart also played a role in recruitment. Hart made contributions in both optimizing the salary structure and acting as a lobbyist. Hart's signing created an interesting contrast: Hart's four-year, 81 million contract extension was advanced, and fans praised it, saying it was worth it; Dillon's 4-year decreasing contract only had a guaranteed portion of 86 million, so why are fans saying they're losing money? ? Di Lung Feng's poor rating is definitely not just a matter of level, everyone knows this. But it is true that Dillon ranked last in the league in BPM in the playoffs. He delivered such data in a very hot series. After witnessing Dillon's suicidal style of play, it makes sense for fans not to accept that he received a big contract. If we were to divide the nine-square grid of Jigsaw players, Hart should be exactly on the opposite diagonal from Dillon. Dillon took 7.1 three-pointers every 36 minutes last season, which was upgraded to 9.1 in the playoffs, and his three-point shooting percentages were 32.6% and 23.8% respectively. Hart only took 2.4 three-pointers every 36 minutes, and 3.3 in the playoffs, with three-point shooting percentages of 37.2% and 31.3% respectively. Both of them were shorted. But when everyone is left open, throwing desperately with a sight that is lower or far lower than the normal efficiency will certainly hurt the team more than throwing less. Hart can feint and move in, trying to find better opportunities for his teammates instead of doing it himself every round. As a 3D wing, Hart has good assist numbers, and careful shot selection helps him maintain a reasonable scoring efficiency. He also relies on his hard work and physical strength to grab some offensive rebounds. After piecing together, Hart is roughly the best on the offensive end. Able to submit a qualified supporting role report card. Do more and make more mistakes, do less and make fewer mistakes. Jigsaw players should have B numbers and only do what they can do. This is nothing new. What’s interesting is the conflicting script seen from Hart and Dillon. Hart is a player who is good at everything. He is strong, energetic, full of energy, tenacious on defense and has a high IQ. The only shortcomings are average height (1.93 meters) and average three-point shooting, and these two things are very critical abilities as a 3D wing. You can't change your height, but you can still practice shooting. But what exactly does Hart think of three-point shooting? If we take Hart's career three-point data alone, you will find that his three-point output in different years has great ups and downs. In the first three seasons of his career, Hart's three-point attempts per 36 minutes were 4.9, 5.8, and 7.3 respectively. The trend of more and more shots is very obvious. But starting from the fourth season, Hart gradually reduced his three-point output, from 7.3 to 5.2, then from 5.2 to 4.3, and finally to 2.4 last season. In the 21-22 season, Hart was traded to the Trail Blazers midway, and his three-point production had a brief explosive rebound. In these 13 games, Hart took 7.2 three-point shots every 36 minutes, with a shooting rate of 37.3%. It can be said that the firepower is the most powerful stage of his career, and the surge in firepower during this period has also made the industry more optimistic about his future with the Trail Blazers, believing that the team has exchanged CJ for an ideal puzzle piece that is more functional and suitable. But these 13 rebounds cannot explain too many problems. At that time, the Trail Blazers had entered the record dive stage, and there were players of all types who were still playing. As the more capable among these people, Hart made sense to let himself go. Among them, he even scored 44 points during this period. Hart's surge in three-point production is not unrelated to his improvement in positioning. After returning to a pure puzzle position next season, he became cautious in his choice of shots. Hart was very strong in college. However, he entered the league with the 30th overall pick. Whether he was with the Lakers or the Pelicans, he was surrounded by a group of high-talented future stars. He played in a more ""B number"" way and became the fans' favorite ""only player"". The type of supporting actor who knows how to work hard and never steals the show is his successful philosophy to this day. However, as a short wing, even if he contributes game content that exceeds the height limit, if he wants to become the top member of the wing puzzle style, it is necessary to make up for his shortcomings in three-pointers, and this premise must be that in When standing outside, you should at least have the desire to shoot. Of course, for the Knicks, this matter is not too fatal. Most of the time, Hart's abilities in all aspects are sufficient. If the Knicks must have a 3D who can shoot from the outside, they still have Grimes and DiVincenzo to choose from. However, on a higher stage, you definitely hope that the players in the team with a salary of close to 20 million will provide sufficient help, rather than being regarded as an option that is confusing to play. Dillon may be the opposite story. Dillon entered the league in the same year as Hart, 15 picks lower than Hart. But Dillon went to a Grizzlies team that was on the eve of the transition between new and old. He was also one of the most important members of the Grizzlies during the transition period. Compared with the members who joined the team later, he was older. The Grizzlies' configuration lacks ball-handling players, so Dillon has played a role close to the core player in the early stages of his career. Dillon's career round share is 23.2%. In the 3 years of the 19-20 season, 20-21 season, and 21-22 season, the round share was 25.2%, 26.1%, and 28.8% respectively. This is a proper second master. Ball possession. In the 21st playoffs, Dillon had a possession rate of 28.3%, a true shooting percentage of 59.5%, and an average of 25.8 points per game in the series, while the opposite center was named Gobert. So, where does Dillon’s confidence come from? He has always had this status with the Grizzlies. It was indeed awesome. However, there was only one series in which Dillon was purely awesome. More often than not, Dillon's high production and low efficiency coexist, and his career true shooting rate of 51.2% speaks volumes. Dillon's inefficiency and high productivity were allowed, and it has always been based on one premise - there are not many people in the Grizzlies who can do his job. Before 3J gradually matured and Bane proved his attributes other than a shooter, Dillon's ball-handling order Ranking behind Morant is generally in line with the configuration reality. The Grizzlies have always had a strange phenomenon: on the one hand, they need Dillon, who is difficult to replace on both offense and defense; on the other hand, the Grizzlies' biggest shortcoming is exactly Dillon - the Grizzlies need to change If you want to get better, you have to find someone who can take over Dillon's job and do it better than him. After 3J and Bane grew up, Dillon's functionality began to gradually become no longer scarce, and it was no longer acceptable for him to continue to maintain the way he played in the past. The gameplay during the transitional period can only be used during the transitional period. It is inappropriate to continue playing like this at the next level. The following is Dillon's career BPM situation: It is hard to imagine that for a player of Dillon's level, it is impossible to find a positive number in his career BPM table. BPM definitely underestimated Dillon's contribution to the game. Let's not talk about defense. DBPM does not have much reference significance. OBPM will also be much lower than other models, such as O-LEBRON and O-RAPTOR. But in terms of the underlying logic differences between different models, OBPM underestimated Dillon, which just shows that Dillon's inefficient play style will hurt the team even more without the special situation of the Grizzlies' poor main attack and strong rebounding. The Rockets he is about to go to are a team full of young talents. Their ability to rush and steal is similar to that of the Grizzlies, but the needs for young people to grow and take over the power, making him a pure puzzle player, are also very similar, and the reason why he did not Being able to stay with the Grizzlies is precisely because of the failure to transform from the ""second boss"" positioning to a pure Jigsaw. Apparently, at least until the end of last season, Dillon wasn't ready to change himself. Hart and Dillon have opposite stories. One is very knowledgeable about current affairs, but does too little in the advanced exams. The other is the failure to recognize oneself when facing new changes. They jointly told two opposite truths: if you don’t try bravely because you can’t do it well, you will see the end; if you still try forcefully even though you know you can’t do it well, you are likely to make more mistakes. This is contradictory? In fact, this is not difficult to understand. Life choices are like shooting from the outside. It may go in or not. The moment you take the shot, you must be prepared to bear the consequences. So: Do your age, job, family background, etc. allow you a certain amount of room for trial and error? If so, you can put more thought into pursuing higher goals and achievements. If all conditions do not allow you to make mistakes easily, then messing around is not as reliable as sticking to your duties. #nba#久久的天堂#Secretly powerful#",,,,"nba, secretly great",4,5,64,8/11/23 21:17,Weibo web version,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006BeA6Ely1hgt3rxl52wj32xk1jk7mh.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/006BeA6Ely1hgt3s17y31j30hs0bvq3t.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/ large/ 006BeA6Ely1hgt3s2y5e8j306v06qq4r.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006BeA6Ely1hgt3s4f8ltj30i20c1wfd.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/006BeA6Ely1hgt3s8n febj32gd1mxkjn.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg. cn/large/006BeA6Ely1hgt3s7aaikj31kw11zdiq.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006BeA6Ely1hgt3s7crmbj31z41e87gi.jpg']",,

4.93E+15,Ne598zVpi,1787124455,boiler cat three,"August 8, 2023 is the beginning of autumn, and the rule here is that you should eat some watermelon. In such a busy day, as a fan, you should check out Weibo. Let’s see what kind of performance the basketball celebrities who are far away from home can do while watching the warm-up match between the United States and Puerto Rico. Section 1: As I expected, America is just like this. Section 2: As expected, the provincial team cannot be underestimated. Section 3: I have said it before, the United States is very strong. Section 4: As you know, so does China. Of course, this scene had already appeared before and after China’s victory over Cape Verde. According to my observation, after the victory over Cape Verde, many people shed tears at the level of family sacrifices. The expression was somewhat Serbian. The meaning of the famous coach being alive and dead, the despair since 2019 was swept away, and a feeling of excitement floated in the air; then he lost to Italy by 18 points, wow. However, these are normal emotions. If you insist on showing a bitter and resentful expression after winning, you will easily be labeled as an ""unreasonable guest"". It is better to enjoy the happiness of the world first. As for when to worry, the next time Let’s talk about it later. Of course, there are professionals who are always worried, not only in China, but also in the United States. Arenas, the veteran football commentator, said: ""What cats and dogs we send out."" Of course, the general speaks more politely than me. He originally said The wording was ""sorry-ass"", and I interpreted it a little bit. What the general means is that this U.S. team lacks star flavor. ""I have never heard of some people, and some may not even start in their own teams."" However, we took a closer look at the U.S. team's lineup. Among them, only Portis plays the sixth man role with the Bucks. Even Rivers, although he didn't start much in the Lakers' regular season last season, he played 16 games in the playoffs. All starters, averaging 36 minutes per game, he is basically the third most important figure in the Lakers after James. Arenas said these words on a talk show. Trae Young, who was sitting next to him, said that he really wanted to play for his country, but was rejected by the U.S. team on the grounds that he was ""not suitable for the team."" With the general's impassioned speech. So we can also understand that the general is not commenting on the ball, but the world. What Arenas said is not completely unreasonable. This US team does lack big names. The total number of All-Stars is only 4. Of course, this kind of dim starlight also depends on who you compare it to. Before 1992, there were no All-Stars in the U.S. team. After all, in previous international competitions, most of the national team members they sent out came from schools, the military, or other amateur leagues. The reason for this arrangement is mainly due to FIBA's own requirement that amateur players must participate in the competition. In 1989, FIBA was reformed under the leadership of Stankovic and voted to allow professional players to participate in two major events. What’s interesting is that the United States voted against it, and in the NBA at that time, only 58% of players said they wanted to participate in the Olympics. One of the most conspicuous opponents was undoubtedly Isaiah Thomas, the leader of the two-peat Pistons who was in his prime at the time. So who kicked the Smiling Assassin out of the dream team three years later and for what reason is still a topic worth exploring. But even if only 50% of the players are willing to participate in the Olympics, it is still a huge advantage for the US men's basketball team. Except for the lockout in 1998, after 1992, the United States sent NBA players to participate in the World Championships (World Cup) and the Olympics. Among so many Dream Of course, it is difficult to evaluate the stardom of that team in 2019. After all, the ordinary All-Star Walker contributed to 3 All-Stars alone, and the more marginal Luo and Middleton each contributed 1 time. U.S. team coach Kerr turned a deaf ear to the opinions of opposition experts like Arenas. His posture was one of confidence rather than belief. ""Our lineup is too decent!"" This expression of belief It must be a family tradition. Cole’s mentor Popovich also expressed a similar meaning in an interview with media dispatched by the International Basketball Association before coaching the 2019 U.S. team: ""Being able to coach the best players in the world in the World Cup is really a blessing. ""It's exciting."" It's just that the 2018 training camp originally had a 35-man roster, and many stars, including Lillard, also temporarily withdrew before going to Beijing in 2019. Maybe you can only understand the American people's choice of Popovich at this time. There is a small reason why Qi took over the old K to coach the US team: There may be few big-name coaches in the NBA world who can adapt to the trauma of superstars leaving the team better than Popovich. At this point, when we look back at Cole, it seems There are similar experiences, and the choice of the American Basketball Association is indeed reasonable and convincing. Another fact is that the U.S. lineup for the 2019 Beijing World Cup is so thin, but at the postponed Tokyo Olympics, you will see players such as Durant, Booker, Dream Chaser, Lillard, Holiday, and Towers. Stars such as Thumu and Adebayo fill the roster. In recent years, Americans' attitude of favoring one over the other has become quite clear. The internal reason may be related to the original name of the World Cup. Its original name is the FIBA World Championship, which in English is FIBA World Championship. If you look up at the NBA championship flag, it also says ""world championships"". Americans have their own ideas about where to win the championship. On the other hand, there is some history that everyone is familiar with. This history should start with the 2000 Sydney Olympics. They only defeated Lithuania by 9 points in the group stage, setting a record for the smallest margin of victory for an NBA player in a World Series. Then they met Lithuania again in the semifinals. Sri Lanka missed a three-pointer in the last second, and the American team escaped. When the buzzer sounded in this game, the scene of Carter kneeling in prayer may be more suggestive of the true strength of American basketball in the world than his previous leap over the Frenchman for the dunk of the century. So by the 2002 World Championships in the United States, it was useless for the stars to kneel down and pray to God. The U.S. team, composed of second-rate stars, was immediately defeated and created many firsts: it was defeated by Argentina in the group stage, the first time in history that an NBA team was defeated; it was eliminated by Yugoslavia in the quarter-finals, and it was the first time in history that an NBA team was defeated. Eliminated; lost to Spain in the qualifying round. I don’t know what this is the first time in history. In the end, they only finished sixth. According to the competition system that year, the United States had to participate in the 2003 Americas Championship to get a ticket to the 2004 Athens Olympics. At that time, the patriotic sentiment of the stars from all walks of life was high, showing a grand appearance, so big names such as Iverson, Tracy McGrady, Carter, Duncan, Kidd, Ray Allen, etc. all came out. Even the old Malone was invited. Of course, In the end, he still missed the trip due to injury, but it was more than enough for the U.S. team to sweep across the Americas and get an Olympic ticket. But before heading to Greece, 9 of the 12 stars participating in the Americas Championship withdrew. The American Basketball Association was very anxious and went to ask all the experts. As a result, Tracy McGrady got married, Kidd and O'Neal went to recuperate from injuries, and Kobe still had a case to deal with...The team coach at the time, Larry Brown, was just like Pop now. Veach is as confident as Cole: ""It doesn't matter, there are still many pure children who want to join the national team."" Regardless of the irony in Old Brown's statement of belief, the pure children have really come. 03 The three heroes James, Melo and Wade have just spent their rookie seasons. According to their age, they are still college students, and they are already ready to conquer the world with Duncan, Iverson and Marbury. Or, be conquered by the world. The 2004 Athens Olympics was the U.S. men's basketball team's worst loss in Olympic history. In the first game of the group stage, it was beaten by Puerto Rico by 19 points, setting a record for the largest loss in team history. Then it lost to Lithuania in the group stage, and was eliminated by Argentina in the semifinals. Got a bronze medal. On the final podium, the three 03 heroes were like mourning, and the dream team turned into a nightmare team. Wade said this was the most disappointing moment since he started sports. ""Our goal is not medals, but gold medals. We will also lose in the NBA."" But we know there is always tomorrow, but here, there is no tomorrow. Losing here is more painful than losing in the finals."" This painful emotion finally spread back to the United States, and the whole country was shocked. We Americans Now basketball can’t even rule the world? Reform, must reform! After this, there was the Colangelo New Deal in 2005, hiring old coach K, studying FIBA rules, disbanding the selection committee, setting up a large training camp, and preventing the national team selection from becoming an All-Star vote. And the last three-year plan is to train in preparation for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In this three-year plan, in 2006, the three heroes of 2003 once again led the team to the World Championships in Japan as co-captains. They lost to Greece in the semi-finals and came back with another bronze medal. But from this time on, we already knew that American Basketball National strategy: The World Championships are just for training, the Olympics are the top priority. This set of preparation ideas was also settled at this time. After 2008, the U.S. men’s basketball team has never let the Olympic gold medal fall by the wayside, and it does not matter whether it is the World Championships or the World Cup. It is just that since 2008, inertia has led to the occasional participation of big names. The U.S. men's basketball team also won two consecutive world championships. But in 2019, the rules for entering the Olympics were drastically changed. The United States only needed to be among the top two in the Americas in the World Cup to get tickets, so it became a simple springboard. In 2019, the United States only finished seventh in the World Cup in Beijing, but it still entered the Olympics with Brazil. The lack of any movement in the United States is due to this. Just complete the task and don't ask too much. So the current World Cup has essentially become a large-scale training camp in the US men's basketball three-year Olympic cycle rolling plan. As a training camp, it is important to send young players who may provide actual combat capabilities at the 2024 Paris Olympics to adapt to international competitions in advance. The personnel selection of this U.S. national team also has clear goals. The team's defenders, shooters, insiders, and one-on-one players are relatively balanced. The enthusiasm is high and the confidence is abundant. Especially on the defensive end, it seems that there is really no defensive shortcoming like boasting. Needless to say, players such as 3J and Ohashi are known for their defense in the NBA. Every time the team talks about their strengths, they must mention defense. After a big win over the provincial team in the first game, Huazi, who scored 15 points, said nothing about his offense. He said, ""I succeeded by anticipating the opponent's offense and using the defensive skills God gave me."" 3J He Ke I am also full of praise for Hua Zi. This is a core point after all. International basketball encourages confrontation and there are many physical contacts without whistles. But our American team has good physical fitness. This is so damn awesome. ""On the defensive end, we can even put our bodies on the offensive players to prevent them from breaking through!"" That's a good point, but I don't know why, but I saw that Cole and the young people didn't whistle for the physical confrontation in international basketball. Being so intoxicated, I always had an ominous premonition. They used their bodies to crush Puerto Rico, and they felt that they had mastered the essence of international basketball and could use the same method to crush the whole world. I always feel like something is wrong with this idea, and I can’t say for sure. Compared with the 2019 World Cup, four years have passed. The cup is still the same cup, and the strategy is still the same. It’s just that the people participating are very different, and the fans watching are still the same. Maybe it's changed. As evidence that the world is still functioning normally, the endless cycle of sports events seems to never stop, telling us that everything is still the same and everything is under control. But we all know that many things have changed dramatically. Things have changed and people have changed. This is the correct label for these four years. Maybe it is the same for every four years. It is just that it is difficult for you and me to make a comprehensive description. And description, maybe only storytellers many years in the future can clarify one, two, three, four for you, just like what I did in the previous article. However, such a comprehensive review will inevitably lose too many specific facts, and these specific facts or tiny details can only be appreciated by those of us who are involved. For example, Mao San, who is recording the history of the US men's basketball team at this time, will suddenly feel a little nostalgic. I miss the way a man said ""Team USA, don't think you are safe"" in a promotional video four years ago. It seemed that there was nothing wrong with replacing ""Team America"" in this sentence with something else. Don't think that you are stable, and don't think that we are stable. . #basketballsummerdoesn’tcool##2023basketballworldcup#",,,,"Basketball won’t cool down in summer, 2023 Basketball World Cup",2,7,18,8/11/23 14:52,Weibo web version,,,

Please stay tuned, Lao Yang will definitely have something to tell! Today we will continue to talk about the three games. Please like, follow and support Lao Yang. League: Friday 003 Time: 08-1203:00 Team: Burnley VS Manchester City Age: 12 years old, 02 years old, 13 years old Suggestion: Lose Let’s talk about the Premier League opening match between Burnley and Manchester City first. As a newly promoted team, Burnley introduced many players in the summer window to strengthen the lineup, but it is still unknown whether they can get used to the rhythm of the Premier League in the first game. Manchester City signed two Croatian internationals Kovacic and Gvardiol in the summer to further strengthen their lineup. Looking at the overall strength in Europe, it is basically unrivaled. However, Manchester City has always been slow to start. This game Even if it can be won, it is estimated that it will be difficult to win. League: Friday 004 Time: 08-1203:00 Team: Nice VS Lille Age: 11 years old, 12 years old, 02 years old Recommendation: Lose/draw Then the match between Nice and Lille in French Ligue 1. After Lille sent away Weah, they retained their top scorer David. The overall lineup did not change too much, and their performance in the preseason was also relatively good. Nice has changed a lot since then. Not only has the coach been replaced, but many key players have also left the team. Judging from the performance in the preseason, the strength has dropped a lot compared to last season. This game gave both sides a zero start. I believe in the state. A better Lille can turn against the visitors. League: Friday 005 Time: 08-1204:00 Team: Sevilla VS Valencia Age: 10 years old, 20 years old, 21 years old Suggestion: Win Finally, let’s talk about Sevilla and Valencia in La Liga. Sevilla poached their main defensive midfielder Sou from Frankfurt in the summer, which greatly improved the midfielder's hardness and interception ability. After Valencia's core midfielder Moussa left the team, they did not introduce a strong midfielder to reinforce them. Judging from their preseason performance, their current offense is very struggling and their play is relatively chaotic. This game gave Seve Leah supported the first pitch and was optimistic that they could get off to a good start. NBA game updates are in the video and top workbook.

While watching the live broadcast, I paid attention to the situation of several competing teams. There are 9 teams. Except for the mobile games and the Wa team, I am familiar with the captains of the other 7 teams. The players are basically the commentators and hosts of the LPL and LDL, newcomers to work and the older generation of TV players. Everyone is competing. The level of players is also uneven. The form of the captain selection process from the beginning is quite attractive. It is a way to imitate the NBA team manager draft. Players who register for the competition will report their positions according to their ranking levels, which are divided into SSR, SR, and R cards. According to each captain The previous Commentary Cup record is used to arrange draft picks, which is analogous to the first and second rounds of the NBA draft with 30 players each. There are solo laners, junglers, and supports in each category. It depends on how the captain of each team weighs the choices. The advantage of this selection method is that it can ensure that each team gets what they need, so that the strength of each team is as balanced as possible, and avoids the disadvantages of blind box draws in previous games. As the most stable solo player in ten thousand years, Letme has also steadily selected a relatively good lineup for the game. Since it was the first time for him and Doinb to participate in such a competition, Letme was placed in the middle position among the seven captains, probably based on the length of time they had left the professional game. This also played a decisive role in the selection of subsequent players. role. The members of the Letme team are: top laner, letme (captain), jungler, commentator Tianshu (SR), mid laner, commentator DOBY (SR), bottom lane, commentator KINKO (SSR) (female, perennial master shooter), support, Hosted by Pepe (R) (female). Judging from the recent training games, the LETME team's rating is probably above the top 4.

I recorded it on my mobile phone when I was playing 2K11. Seeing this video reminded me of what happened. That night I played a dynasty season game as usual, the Lakers vs. the Knicks. I don’t know what happened to the computer in the first three quarters. It was so accurate and impossible to guard against. I remember that after the third quarter, our team was 25 points behind. And I couldn't make any shots, and I was very frustrated. Old players all know that there will always be times like this when playing single-player. Anyway, maybe our players are not in good condition at that time. I also admit it, forget it if you can’t win. I'm not the kind of player who wants to win 82 games in a season. If I lose, I lose. Sometimes I will save my progress after crying when the computer kills me, and I won't load files and start over. So after the start of the fourth quarter, I was already 25 points behind, and I didn't have much temper. I thought about just shooting a few shots and forgetting if it didn't work. Unexpectedly, no matter how hard Kobe shot, he soon caught up the score to within 15 points, and there was hope. So I cheered up, took a sip of Feizhai Happy Water, sat up straight and played seriously. I think Kobe is already running out of energy, but since he feels good anyway, I won't let him rest and continue playing. Then this scene in the video appeared. After each goal, I recorded the screen with my mobile phone. My physical strength was no longer good, and I hung on to Gatorade the whole time, but I still tortured the Knicks in all kinds of crazy ways. I had fun myself. In the end, we won a comeback. I don't remember how much we won. Kobe probably scored more than 20 points in the fourth quarter. I don’t know why. Maybe the 2K11 program helped me at that time and randomly clicked a BUFF for me. In retrospect, I taste it carefully, and maybe this is why I feel that the current 2K single-player games are becoming less and less fun. The fun of stand-alone is that there are all kinds of unexpected situations and ups and downs of the plot. This is the real NBA, and the plot often develops in places you can't imagine. Otherwise, how did McGrady’s 35 seconds come about in 2004, how did Kobe’s three consecutive three-pointers in overtime come about in 2013, how did Curry’s half-time three-pointer come about in 2016, and how did Lillard’s step back in 2019 come about? How did the halftime buzzer-beater come about? You have no way to explain how these things happened. You can only say that God opened the BUFF for them at that time. The problem with 2K single-player games now is that it is too predictable. You can tell at a glance that the ball will not go in. Even a superstar will not score as long as he extends his hand in front of him. As long as his physical strength is slightly lower, he has to go down and rest. Otherwise, you can't score any goals, and you can even dunk the ball. Therefore, I have the impression that Mike King of 2K said conclusively in an interview a few years ago: Our new system has completely eliminated the ""dice rolling"" element of luck in the game, making the game full of competitiveness. . I thought this was very funny. Basketball is originally a competitive sport full of luck. It certainly has strong skills, but even a marksman like Curry will admit that sometimes scoring or not is just luck. You have completely removed the luck factor from the basketball game. . . Is it still a basketball simulation?

4.93E+15,NdtJmArQD,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"Jokic, a weirdo with a center physique and Bird's style of play, has never appeared in the NBA before. But similar organizing center play has existed before, and is even popular. However, the older players either did not reach Jokic's talent, or did not have the space and ball rights of this era, so they never reached Jokic's height. The emergence and success of Jokic is more like a retro innovation of the center after the opening of basketball space (because of the success of Curry and the Dream Chasers). The most unique feature of Jokic is as we all know: the center gets a lot of ball rights (not the time of holding the ball), acts as a starter, and has the ability to play the ball everywhere. In the early years, more than one center played like this: being a pivot, supporting, passing the ball, and looking for teammates to cut inside. For example, Bill Walton, who won the championship with the Trail Blazers in the 1977s. For example, the bearded Divac comes from the same place as Jokic. For example, Yao Ming's idol, the legendary roof of the world, old Sabonis. The inspiration for Tex Winter’s triangle offense came from Chamberlain and Skyhooks—later applied to Jordan, Shark, Kobe and Gasol in the Bulls. Therefore, the playing styles of Gasol and Jokic are actually similar: although Gasol has not shouldered as heavy a support burden as Jokic. Why did this style of play once become unpopular? Larry Brown once said that the center needs space and ample time to serve as a pivot; NBA 24 seconds is actually more suitable for positional singles. Coupled with the popularity of three-pointers, the four major centers in the 1990s, including Mourning, the five in total, did not focus on support. At that time, the NBA was simple and crude: the Giants would attack alone to attract double attacks, and open three-point shooters would shoot. From 1994 to 1995, Dameng, Ewing, and the Sharks led the team to the finals. Robinson won the scoring title and MVP in one year, just like this. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Kings' Princeton system was able to pass and cut smoothly from the high position. The twin towers of Divac and Webber were actually very similar to Jokic's style. The Kings' point guard Bibby at the time was just like the Nuggets' Mourinho today. Thunder-like: No need to organize, I just dribble and shoot! Then he was beaten by the Lakers OK combination. At the beginning of the 21st century, no matter how good you are in passing and cutting, you still have to fight hard in the playoffs. So in those years, it was OK and Duncan's world. After the no-handcheck rule was reformed in 2004, ball handlers immediately emerged. Nash won two consecutive MVPs, Wade and Parker, two breakthrough monsters, won the 2006 and 2007 Finals MVPs. LeBron won the regular season MVP four times in five years relying on his space shooters. The one time he was missing in the middle, the MVP was the explosive scorer Rose. What was popular in those years were long and flexible men who could match the ball handler: such as Gasol, such as Dirk, such as the Celtics version of KG, such as Bosh. The Warriors won the championship in 2015, and it happened again: the Warriors won the championship and ushered in the era of large space. As we all know: the whole league has begun to shoot three-pointers, which is the surface, and the whole league's space is wider, which is the result. What are the benefits of having more space? The elite passer and high post facilitator is happy. For example, big towers like Nukic can play a role by creating a wall of flesh for Lillard and passing the ball. For example, a passing monster like Diaw can win a championship with the Spurs. For example, Horford, who is an expert in picking and rolling the ball and then distributing the ball, can make money everywhere. Griffin during the Clippers era, when Paul was away, he was the team's chief axis. What if an insider can't do a one-on-one duel, but can do screens, handoffs, high-low connection, and dealing cards at the top of the arc? ——Dream Green, relying on Curry, four championships. Back to Jokic. He is a master of high-post support: top-of-the-arb screen, counterattack and fast break, high-low connection, hand-off pass, pick-and-roll cut inside, pick-and-roll outside cut, cross-court pass, he can do it all. He has more range and post-up ability than Walton, Sabonis, Noah, Brad Miller and Divac, so he scores higher. But the core idea of his game with the Nuggets is still: a center who can act as a screen wall at any point to initiate a two-man turn/play the ball by himself. In fact, it's not just Jokic who has benefited from this wave of trends. Last season's regular season, among the top four teams in the NBA Western Conference in terms of offensive efficiency, three of the assist kings were inside players: the Kings' assist leader and the long-man Sabonis Jr. The Nuggets' assist king is Jokic. The Warriors' assist king is Dream Green. ——The characteristics of these three teams: they all have long organizers, they all have shooters, and they all have a ball carrier (Fox, Murray and Curry) who does not need to be a commander for a long time and has explosive scoring ability. Therefore, the revival of Jokic (and Sasha), a long-term support player, is closely related to the era of large space: the space is wide, and the ball-holding attacker is of great value. The space is wide, there are many shooters, and the ball-holding attackers all have to go through the high pick-and-roll/two-man spin. Therefore, the most precious inside line is to find open shooters while also being able to support the ball holder from a high position. Although old-school fans will feel that the game in this era is not as tough as the early 21st century, but because of the space, this is the most friendly era for good passers, good shooters and good ball-handling attackers. The offensive style that was once extinct in classical style can now be found possible. Supporting the return of the center is just another classic case. For example, if the main trend at that time was not to fight against sharks and focus on hand-to-hand combat at the basket, in fact, when Yao Ming first entered the industry, he once focused on supporting the mid-range, playing with back passes and so on. Talent, after all, can only be displayed in the most suitable times and rules. #Jokic##Sabonis##Wharton#",,,,"Jokic, Sabonis, Walton",14,35,133,8/7/23 15:37,Weibo web version,"['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOly1hgo7vlrjw7g30eg085npe.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOly1hgo7w4ftprg30eg085b2b.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 005ztwqOly1hgo7wb0kbng30eg0aue84.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOly1hgo7vd6jcfg306o03u449.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOly1hgo7wch37zg30eg 085b2c.jpg']",,

4.93E+15,NdrIbttJZ,7479120761,Just love little heat,"The Heat have agreed to sign forward Cole Swider to an ""Exhibit 10"" contract, according to reports from multiple league sources. Swider became a free agent after the Los Angeles Lakers waived him on July 26. Exhibit 10 contracts typically represent an invitation to training camp, do not count against the salary cap or hard salary cap, and can be converted to a two-way contract or a standard one-year minimum salary contract before the start of the regular season. Additionally, the Exhibit 10 contract provides up to $75,000 in guarantees if a player is waived by his NBA team and then switches to that team's G League affiliate and stays there for at least 60 days. But Swider cannot officially sign a new contract with the Heat. Why? Teams cannot sign Exhibit 10 contracts with players until they have 14 players signed to standard contracts (excluding players on two-way deals). Since the Heat currently have 13 players, they cannot officially lock in the development prospects of the Exhibit 10 contract. But as a workaround to that rule, Swider verbally committed to sign an Exhibit 10 contract with the Heat. 6-foot-9 sharpshooting forward Drew Peterson is another person who verbally committed to an Exhibit 10 deal with the Heat this offseason, according to multiple league sources. Counting Peterson and Swider's Exhibit 10 contracts, the Heat's roster for next season has 17 players (13 standard contracts, 2 two-way contracts, 2 Exhibit 10 contracts). NBA teams can carry up to 21 players under contract during the offseason and preseason. Before the start of the regular season, the roster must be reduced to a maximum of 18 players (15 players on standard contracts and 3 players on two-way contracts). Swider went undrafted out of Syracuse University in 2022 after starting his college career at Villanova University. He signed a two-way contract with the Lakers for his first NBA season before being released at the end of July. The 24-year-old averaged 15.2 points and 5.6 rebounds in five Las Vegas Summer League games for the Lakers last month while shooting 45.6% from the field and 42.5% from three-point range. ,impressive. . Swider played most of last season's minutes in the G-League. In 27 games for the Lakers Development League affiliate South Bay Lakers, he averaged 17.1 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game, shooting 50.6% from the field and 43.6% from three-point range. Averaged 7.6 shots per game. Swider also played in seven NBA games for the Lakers as a rookie. In limited NBA playing time last season, he made 3 of 8 three-pointers (37.5%). Swider averaged 4 three-pointers per game during his four-year college career and shot 38.1% from the field. Swider's 6-foot-9 frame and excellent three-point shooting make him an intriguing development prospect, especially after the Heat lost two of their best three-pointers in free agency this summer. After scoring shooters (Max Struss and Gabe Vincent). Amid Lillard trade speculation, sharpshooter Duncan Robinson's future with the Heat remains uncertain. Swider is expected to have the opportunity to compete for a two-way contract and could earn a spot on the Heat's 15-man training camp roster.",,,,,0,0,0,8/7/23 10:28,Weibo web version,['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/008a9CY1gy1hgnyxqhqe0j30iv0am79q.jpg'],,

4.93E+15,NcJ1R8BpM,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"Everyone is saying that the emergence of a dominant giant will change the way small ball is played. However, the existence of Jokic - and other all-around excellent giants of his generation - does not seem to conflict with small ball play; it can even be a help to Jokic. We all say that over the years, half of the shots in the NBA are three-pointers? Seems like it's leaning towards the periphery? However: of the four championships so far in 2020, the 2023 Nuggets have the league's number one center Jokic (who has won two regular season MVPs before), and the 2021 Bucks have the league's number one insider Giannis (who has won two previous regular season MVPs). Regular season MVP), the 2020 Lakers have the No. 1 insider in the Western Conference that year. The past five regular season MVPs: two for Giannis, two for Jokic, and one for Embiid. Except for the Warriors winning the championship in 2022 thanks to Curry's heroics, three of the past four championships have had the league's top insiders; the past five regular season MVPs have been monopolized by three senior players. On the one hand, three-pointers are being shot faster across the NBA. On one side, the giants increasingly rule. Giants and space play do not conflict. Space play is popular throughout the NBA, and one of its benefits is its simplicity. The Warriors' passing and cutting requires special configuration and tacit understanding. Not every team has a historical off-ball threat like Curry or a dealer like Dream Chaser. The Nuggets' passing and cutting needs a pivot like Jokic, and the Kings' routine needs Sasha's support and Fox's ball-handling. Nowadays, many teams, especially rebuilding teams, before they have any routines, simply use a space game: call a group of three-pointers, give the ball to an ace, and you go for it! Wade described how Argentina could pass the ball with ease in 2004, ""They have been playing together for more than ten or twenty years, and they have a tacit understanding."" Later, how did the old coach K let the makeshift team play? In the 2010 World Championships in the United States, Odom played small ball center and played fast. The small ball in space is a booster for the team's offense. The Hawks opened up and let Trae Young hold the ball; the Pistons rebuilt and let Cunningham and Ive maintain the ball; the Thunder rebuilt and asked Kitty to help organize, and Alexander opened up and held the ball; the Magic used Banchero and Fultz. After you sing with Wagner, I will appear; the Hornets speed up with three goals, and Rozier bursts in... The Celtics also tasted the sweetness in the regular season last season: they used a full-space formation to open up, and no one in the starting lineup was more than 206 centimeters. Everyone can shoot three-pointers, and everyone plays comfortably. As for the inability to change positions in the playoffs, that is another matter. This routine is so convenient that it will continue to be popular - especially for teams that are not aiming to win the championship. Small ball pays attention to giving and taking: sacrificing height, muscle and low-post offense and defense in exchange for speed + space. The most direct manifestation is the popularity of space insiders: the 3rd position is matched with the 4th position (LeBron in 2012, Durant during the Warriors), and the 4th position is matched with the 5th position (Dwight was promoted to the center during the Magic era to match the four major shooters) , the Warriors use Dream Chaser), speed, a large number of three-pointers, and the space provided by three-pointers in order to play more smoothly and variedly. In the 2012 playoffs with the Miami Heat, when Bosh was injured, LeBron was even the best on the team when he came on the court. From this perspective: Philadelphia has Embiid, and is he assigned the No. 4 position all year round? Harris, who is 203 centimeters tall, was a small forward when he was with the Magic. Giannis himself is at the 4th position, but Bucks center Lopez protects the basket on defense and soars three points on offense. The Nuggets have Jokic, who was assigned the No. 4 position last season? Gordon, who is 203 centimeters tall, was also a small forward when he was with the Magic. The Nuggets' backup center in the playoffs is Jeff Green. He started as a small forward in 2007 and moved to the 4th position to accommodate Durant. Therefore, excellent giants, three-point shooting space and even lighter forward lines can help each other. When the four major centers competed against each other in 1995, Dameng was flanked by Horry at the 3rd and 4th positions; later Horry also assisted the Sharks and Duncan to win championships. Why do the Big Dream Shark and Duncan match up so well with Horry? Because of his flexibility and three-pointers at the 3rd position (how many winning three-pointers!), and his size at the 4th position. Great giants love this one. The first time the NBA three-point shot took off was in the 1994 and 1995 finals, when Dream, Ewing and the Sharks played in a mixed battle. The bigger they are, the more space they need, and the more they can miniaturize their teammates: Anyway, I'm in charge of the penalty area, so please open up! Teams with giants do not resist space and small balls. Even because of the good giants, the team dared to make light moves in other positions. The Nuggets Bucks are just a tall forward, but they don't play cumbersome at all. They open up space and are very light and flexible. Although the past five MVPs are all giants, they all follow the rules rather than change them: Embiid plays like a seven-foot Melon, Jokic plays like a seven-foot Bird, and Giannis plays like a Dr. J. Seven Feet. Neither of them is a traditional hard-hitting player under the basket, and neither of them is a monster like the Sharks who forced the entire league to hoard meaty balls in the penalty area. Embiid and Giannis are not even top-notch in basket skills; they just happen to be seven feet taller. Just height. In the future, if the basketball rules remain unchanged, they will generally be in a similar direction: strive for the entire team to shoot three-pointers in order to open up space; during the offense, at most one person without a basket will be left on the court to be responsible for the threat to the basket (Fat Tiger, Yang Nice,) or dealing/pick-and-roll (Dream, Sabonis). On the defensive end, without sacrificing space, the last basket defender who is best able to switch defenses is: Jokic for the Nuggets, Adebayor for the Heat, and Rowe for the Celtics. There will be fewer and fewer heavy-duty No. 4 positions, unless that No. 4 position cannot be a basket protector (Fat Tiger). Unless the league changes the no-handcheck rule (which restricts breakthroughs with the ball) or removes the three-point line, space basketball, with one inside, four outside or even five outside, will only become more and more popular. Versatile inside (can support, protect the basket and finish) + ball-handling threat (can instigate pick-and-rolls to start the offense) + space role player (can switch defenses and shoot three-pointers to open up space). This configuration is only growing in popularity. Of course, the more powerful a team wins the championship, the more thickness it will accumulate inside to prepare for the inside fight in the playoffs: the hot Adebayor and Love, the Celtics' Horford and two Williams in the past two years, in 2022 The Warriors' Dream Chaser, Looney and Porter. When it comes to the real fight in the playoffs, teams will need high-quality insiders who can keep up with the pace. But they have to try not to encumber the space in order to be eligible to stand on the court. In this era, when teams with weak defenses play in the regular season, they want to get off to a fast start, not pure blue-collar teams. When a strong defensive team enters the playoffs, what they want is to be able to switch defenses and delay blocking while also opening up space, and they don't want pure blue-collar teams. The Shark eats up space but continues to penetrate the basket for ten years, forcing the opponent to hoard the ball that also has no space. This can be regarded as leaving the ball with nowhere to go. Jokic and Giannis actually benefited from the small ball - their teammates are all space swing types. This is what is called, Jokic, and the outstanding elders of his generation, are not very good at, and do not need to end the small ball era: their offense itself is not as ""big"" as the Sharks, they are just flexible! #Jokic##Embid##NBA#",,,,"Jokic, Embiid, NBA",9,45,172,8/2/23 16:43,Weibo web version,['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hgihpxl4t7j30xc0m8dnu.jpg'],,

When ""Knife Brother"" was traded to the Thunder in 2017, I liked him very much. He is a particularly pure off-ball shooter. Watching him play after so many years, I think he is still the same person: still running tirelessly, shooting three-pointers more lethally than before, still unable to guard anyone. In the past few years, Brother Dao has stabilized his three-point rate at more than 40%. He is an extremely productive and lethal forward shooter. He lacks the ability to hold the ball, so he has to use a lot of off-ball movement and off-ball screens to get shooting opportunities. But once the defender misses the ball and lets him catch the ball, in the words of teammate Tre Jones, ""he only needs 1 inch of space to shoot"" - Dao will shoot it. He took 8.1 shots in 36 minutes and shot 41.4% from three-point range. No one at the same position was better than him in both categories. Due to his high + and fast shooting speed, he does not rely on open shots like the previous electric fans, and his non-open shot rate is as good as open shots.

Curry admits he has considered it, but for now he is focusing on his chance to succeed again. He firmly believes that basketball will not be with him forever, but he said he is not considering retiring anytime soon. The 35-year-old Curry can still average 29.4 points, 6.1 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 0.9 steals and 0.4 blocks in 34.7 minutes per game. Who is the greatest shooter in history besides himself? Curry thinks it is Ray Allen. He has won Curry's admiration for his unique shooting posture, his dedication and dedication to the shooting technique, and his outstanding performance at critical moments. Curry said that Ray Allen not only ranks among the top in terms of three-point goals, but also has the honor of two championships and a three-point contest championship, making him one of the 75 major stars in the NBA. In particular, his key three-pointer in G6 of the 2013 Finals has become a classic moment and will always be engraved in the hearts of fans. Which three defenders are the toughest to deal with. Curry mentioned Holiday, Tony Allen and Artest. These three defenders always make him feel uncomfortable. They can almost completely suppress Curry's offensive state on the court. In particular, Curry's description of Artest emphasized his opponent's strong arms and excellent stealing ability, which made Curry very troubled on the court. When will it really be noticed by the outside world? Curry recalled that in the fourth season of his career, he scored 54 points in an away game against the New York Knicks. Although he ultimately lost the game, that game changed people's perception of him. Curry's performance made the outside world realize that he is a player who is not afraid of strong opponents and has outstanding abilities, and opponents have to be wary of him. #NBATucaoConference##NBA#",,,,"NBA Tucao Conference, NBA",0,0,0,8/1/23 5:05,NBA Super Talk,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hggrxmefulj30u011hq82.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hggrxme7wbj30u011haes.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/ 006MqMwHgy1hggrxmg746j30u00z50wu.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hggrxmj1wdj30u011iqc6.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hggrxmd62 jj30u011in1g.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg. cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hggrxmckk0j30u011hq5g.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hggrxmmay6j30u011hdn8.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hggrx mu8f1j30u00z5di5.jpg', 'https:// wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hggrxmbcy4j30u00z540t.jpg']",,

Unconsciously, the core lineup of the Golden State Warriors has been used for about 10 years. They have won multiple NBA championships and created a Warriors dynasty. Salary cut and contract renewal! The Warriors sharpshooter made the final assist and had to advance and retreat with Curry. But 10 years have passed and the players are getting older. The Warriors want to make a smooth transition. They have spent a lot of effort training players such as Poole, Kuminga and Wiseman, hoping that these younger players can take over for veterans such as Curry. But the reality is that the younger generation of Warriors players have performed poorly and lacked strength. Wiseman has been sent away, Poole has been replaced by the older Chris Paul, and Kuminga's playing time is not much. Obviously, after the Warriors have exhausted their existing core lineup, they have to start a long rebuilding process. They have no new stars worth cultivating. In this way, it is actually a better choice for the veteran to cut his salary and renew his contract in a timely manner to pave the way for the team's reconstruction. Thompson already has similar ideas. Previously, the Warriors had already renewed Draymond Green, and their next step is to renew Thompson. After experiencing two serious injuries, Thompson lost his former courage. His shooting performance in the playoffs was not stable, and he no longer had enough explosive power, so he withdrew from the ranks of All-Star players. Salary cut and contract renewal! The Warriors sharpshooter made the final assist and had to advance and retreat with Curry. But if you have to make do with it, Thompson can still be used, so the contract extension given by the Warriors is very clever. It is understood that Thompson will not complete the contract extension with the Warriors this summer, and he is expected to discuss the issue again next summer. Thompson is eligible for an early extension this summer, but he wants to wait and see what happens next year. Salary cut and contract renewal! The Warriors' marksman made the final assist. To advance and retreat with Curry, Green already had to cut his salary and renew his contract. The average annual salary of his new contract is about US$25 million, which is not expensive in today's NBA. Thompson's final year of contract is as high as $43.2 million. He is not expected to receive that much money next summer. Like Green, he will renew a contract with an annual salary of about $25 million.

4.93E+15,Ncs4h8XGR,6748483996,Qiu Mo Austin,"#400人计划#No.96Domantas Sabonis King, center, 27 years old, 216cm-109kg-211cm. Sabonis’ official height is actually 216. Considering that this is the result of official re-measurement in recent years, it is really shocking. Savoy may be recognized as the second best inside organizer in the league, with a strong body, handy skills, and delicate skills. He is a rare interior offensive core in the league and played a huge role in the Kings' return to the playoffs. With Haliburton performing so well, the deal turned out to be a win-win. 23 The Kings are a team where everyone complements each other and benefits, everyone benefits while benefiting others, whether it is role players or dual cores. The Kings' shooters benefited from Sabonis' high screens, handoffs, and inside passes. Sabonis also thrived in the open offensive space. In fact, Sabonis is not the kind of player who can score steadily one-on-one against defenders, and he may not be able to eat people in the low post, but at least in the regular season he plays with both efficiency and aggression. Although Sabonis is an inside man with mediocre dynamic talents and a short wingspan, his confidence in attacking the frame is not bad at all, and he is definitely not the kind of soft white inside man. Sabonis' defensive contribution is mainly reflected in his superb backcourt rebound protection. Not only is he the league's rebounding leader + back rebounding leader, but the team's backcourt rebound protection is also very, very good when he is on the court; but when it comes to the defensive job of protecting the inside, this is Sabonis's shortcoming. He rarely switches defense and instead hunkers down, but he can't block shots and can't really stop good rim attackers. However, being unable to defend is not a fatal flaw in the 23 Kings team. If you only look at data like BPM, Sabonis can even be called a single-core, but in the playoffs he played very poorly as expected. His passing influence was greatly reduced, there were more turnovers, his offense was a mess, and he couldn't defend. But This isn't the first time Sabonis has struggled in the playoffs, either. The 16+11 panel looked okay, but being stepped on by Green was probably his most significant moment in the series. For a variety of reasons, I streamed all seven of the Kings' playoff games this year. My biggest question about Sabonis, aside from those botched knocks/downs at the rim, is: Why doesn't he take long shots? If there is no long-range threat, aren't you deceiving yourself and others by standing in a high position to provide support? In fact, Green stood in the three-second zone and ignored him when Sabonis was ""supporting"" him. Sabonis stood in the high post and was completely unable to open up the inside space. And even when faced with Green or Looney's open shots, Sabonis rarely takes a shot. I would tend to put him on the same level as Fox. Fox is obviously a more useful player in the playoffs and the true leader of the Kings (key ball or temperament). This ""dual-core"" is still young. They get along well with each other and perform well in the system. I think the Kings will perform very well in the next few years.

At first glance, Bane's body looks like a frame-attacking breakthrough player, but in fact, he has delicate shooting skills, lively hands, and soft throws. He has a girl's heart hidden in his macho body. Bane entered the industry as a super-efficient three-point shooter. In the second year, he was pushed into the starting lineup due to Allen's departure. He got a lot of offensive opportunities when Morant was playing intermittently and Dillon was injured for 50 games, and then he seized the opportunity. Become an efficient secondary attacker for the Grizzlies; in the absence of JJJ at the beginning of this season, Bain once averaged an All-Star performance of 25+5+5 and 63ts per game. Later, he suffered a toe injury and his condition has been up and down since his return. Throughout the regular season, Bain still had a 21+5+4 panel, achieving improvement in the third year. Some Grizzlies fans believe that his three-pointers are not as stable as before, mainly due to the decline in the certainty of non-open shots, which is different from the previous two years' perception that ""as long as the defender is not close to the defense, he is basically stable""; but first of all, Bane's last season Three-point shooting is at the ""super accurate"" level. It has declined this season, but it is still compared with his own. He is still a top three-point shooter with 8 shots in 36 minutes with a shooting rate of over 40%. At the same position, only three people including Thompson have the highest number of shots and hits. are higher than him in shooting percentage (there are only 7 players in the league); secondly, except for the slight regression in 23-point grasp of three-pointers, other aspects of the game have improved, and this is an improvement that determines the level of improvement. 22Bain's production looks very good on paper, but in fact it is just a continuation of the 21st season. He still prefers the position of ""shooter"" and relies heavily on the shooting environment and the quality of his teammates' ball distribution. If you watched last year's second round playoffs, you would be shocked by his near-disappearance on the court. There is high efficiency in vain, but in reality it is impossible to do anything. 23 Bain has become a tough player who relies less on space. This season he has made many more mid-range pull-up jumpers and pull-up jumpers after pick-and-rolls, which are very efficient; he has more ""one-stop layups with the ball in the backcourt"", which has become his signature point-grabbing/stealing Pointing method; he has a very soft touch near the frame and a high shooting percentage. G4 in the first round of 23 is the masterpiece of Bain's career. You can feel his substantial improvement compared to last year: a large number of one-on-ones, difficult layups, and decisive shooting confidence when getting good shots. This is what a qualified team's secondary attacker looks like. Where Bain needs to make further progress next season: 1) His three-point shooting cannot fall below 40%, which is his important strategic deterrent weapon. 2) He needs to improve his luck control level. As a second-position player, his ball control is actually substandard. He often makes mistakes when the team gives him more tasks to control the ball. His ability to break the double attack is currently also very poor. 3) Passing vision. Take your time with this. Currently, he can hardly see the open teammates on both sides when attacking the basket, so he often receives some shots that are destined to be received. But with Adams returning (you know how much his coverage adds to Bayne's style of play) + Morant's suspension, Bayne will be the team's first ball-handling core for a long time next season. He averages a game A season of 23 points + 60ts would not surprise me at all.

4.93E+15,NccYLCkDK,2397007784,cute wind p,"#体育##NBA# The Lakers’ two-for-one trade plan has attracted much attention recently. According to US media reports, the Lakers are negotiating with Chris Paul regarding a potential trade to the Warriors. The Lakers will send D'Angelo Russell and Jonathan Schiffino in exchange for Paul. The trade plan is not only related to the future of the Lakers, but also to the development of the Warriors. First, from the Lakers' perspective, the trade plan is obviously a risky but worthwhile endeavor. The Lakers' performance last season was quite bumpy. Even with James, Big Eyebrows, and shooters, the organization and connections were still insufficient. The addition of Paul will provide the Lakers with valuable experience and leadership. Paul has always performed well at critical moments in the playoffs, and his organizational and coordination skills can also make the Lakers' offense more smooth and efficient. Paul's defense is also very good. His defensive awareness and ability can improve the Lakers' overall defensive level. So from the Lakers' perspective, this trade plan is well worth trying. But from the Warriors' perspective, this deal is also pretty good. Russell is an excellent scorer who can play a key role in the Warriors' offense. Cifino is a young player with potential who is very active on both offense and defense. The Warriors performed very well under a full offensive and defensive tactical system, but the trade plan may lead to a decline in the Warriors' overall strength. After all, Paul has a wealth of experience, but his defensive and offensive style does not match the Warriors' tactical system. In addition, as Paul's contract expires at the end of this season, the Warriors will have to consider renewing his contract, which will also have an impact on the Warriors' salary structure. Therefore, the trade plan has pros and cons for the Lakers and Warriors. For the Lakers, this is a risky but worthwhile attempt. For the Warriors, it is a talent introduction and an unknown challenge. However, if this deal becomes a reality, it could have a significant impact on both teams' futures. First of all, for the Lakers, Paul's joining can improve the Lakers' overall strength and organizational strength. Paul's playoff experience and leadership will help the Lakers move toward maturity and stability. In addition, Paul's defensive and organizational skills can make up for the Lakers' defensive and organizational deficiencies. These advantages will help the Lakers advance to the next level in the playoffs and possibly even challenge the Warriors for dominance in the Western Conference. Secondly, the Warriors got two potential players in Russell and Cifino, but the Warriors have already formed a good chemical reaction and tacit understanding under the all-out tactical system. So even if the two join, the Warriors' tactical system will not change much. However, the addition of Russell may affect the Warriors' overall strength and chemical reaction, and the Warriors need to constantly seek and adapt during running-in and adjustments. So this two-for-one trade plan is a win-win for both the Lakers and the Warriors.",,,,"sports, NBA",0,0,0,7/30/23 7:08,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hgccj8duj6j20hs09jmxv.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hgccj8f170j20hf07ywf6.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/ 7ea3385dly1hgccj8d63bj20hs09y74q.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hgccj8df9kj20hs0b8t92.jpg']",,

This news has been confirmed by the Bucks Notified Warriors management, but has yet to receive a response. According to the trade plan, the Bucks will give Khris Middleton, Julius Junior, Brook Lopez, two first-round picks and two second-round picks. This is a huge deal aimed at improving the Bucks' strength and creating a more comprehensive lineup for the team. The Bucks management stated that if the Warriors are not satisfied with the deal chips, they are willing to negotiate, and said that in addition to the team's core Antetokounmpo, other players can also participate in the transaction. This shows that the Bucks hope to use this deal to consolidate their competitive position in the Eastern Conference and further enhance the team's championship competitiveness. This news caused quite a stir in NBA circles. Stephen Curry is one of the most influential three-point shooters in NBA history. His arrival will bring a lot of threats to the Bucks' offensive end. Andrew Wiggins is an excellent shooting guard, and his excellent shooting and defensive abilities will further enhance the Bucks' overall strength. Trump is a young player with great potential, and his arrival will inject new energy and future development space into the Bucks. However, there are some unknowns and challenges with this agreement. First, it remains to be seen whether Warriors management is satisfied with the trade chips provided by the Bucks. The Warriors must evaluate the long-term benefits of this deal before deciding whether to accept it. Secondly, the Bucks may need to further adjust their trading chips to suit the needs of the Warriors, which will require more in-depth negotiations between the two parties.

4.93E+15,NbZI0ApzU,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Durant’s three fronts...] Before Kyrie Irving chose to attack, the Nets had 32 wins and 20 losses, ranking 4th in the Eastern Conference and 5th in the league. Considering that it has been almost a month since Durant's truce, this is a decent result. The Nets showed some good content, and the switching defense system gradually took shape. Claxton played like a quasi-All-Star. O'Neal proved the significance of the team's acquisition of him. Watanabe and Sumner replaced Brown and became the source of vitality. There is also something about the off-ball performance of the Xi shooters. Of course, the most important thing is that the Nets fired Nash. Until the last day of 2022, the Nets' record was still ranked second in the league, and Durant's name was also listed on the MVP list. Is everything going to be okay? I'm afraid that's not the case. After experiencing the story of the Nets in the past two years, even at the time, you would not react too enthusiastically to these seemingly optimistic plots of the Nets. Recall that at the beginning of 2022, Durant's call for MVP will be higher than a year later. This does not prevent him from encountering an embarrassing 0-4 at the end of April that year. Even without Irving's backstabbing, the Nets have little chance of standing out from the Eastern Conference in the summer of 2023. Durant's recovery time from injuries is far longer than expected. It is really difficult for the Nets to solve the structural problems of the lineup, and these are all stubborn problems of the team that have nothing to do with Irving. The situation is similar on the other side - was the Irving trade the fundamental reason why the Mavericks failed to make the playoffs? ""Zeng Xisi"" is a story that everyone is familiar with. In fact, more than one of the ""Zeng Xiyi"" teams failed to make the playoffs this season. The Mavericks lost Bronson, resulting in a lack of development resources. This hole will have to be filled sooner or later. The difference is just during the season or during the vacation. Irving appeared on the market, and the Mavericks broke up the lineup to grab people. This was a big move. They ran too fast and lost their temper, resulting in a sudden ending to the season. This transaction allowed the Mavericks to indirectly give up a season that could last for a while, but could collapse at any time. In the short term, it is a step back, but in the long term, it is hard to say. In a sense, Irving's self-destruction tore off everyone's disguise and revealed the truth that they were not doing well, objectively promoting their own changes. Looking at it now, all parties affected by this incident seem to be doing well: Irving got the money; the Mavericks replenished their talent; and the Nets gained relief and new life. OK. So, what about Durant? You can't attribute Durant's departure from the Nets entirely to Irving's self-destruction. All the chaos has worn away Durant's patience. If he is eliminated from the playoffs again - considering the competitive situation at the top of the Eastern Conference, this possibility is very high - without Irving taking action first, he will be eliminated. would burst into management's offices. After Irving left the team, Durant became the next one non-stop. In the rush, you can hardly say that his departure was thoughtful enough, but it was definitely not a sudden thought. The Suns did not intend to do this for a day or two. The subsequent series of operations also show that after changing to a new boss, the Suns have an unstoppable internal drive to engage in stud, and they also have a clear and clear execution direction. Because the Suns have done things clearly, Durant's new start once again got off to a good start. Isn't this more comfortable than spending time with Irving in the Nets? Looking at it this way, Durant might have to hum ""The last love is to let go of my hand"" when he saw Irving. After those two waves of big transactions, everyone has a bright future, so why regret it? If you take the Nets and Durant's constipation predicament as the background setting by default, then Durant has indeed regained a new lease of life due to Irving's departure. But as long as you look back a little bit and don't have any regrets about those years, you'll be in a good mood. From the time Durant recovered from a serious injury in the 20-21 season to the time he left the team in the 22-23 season, it was close to three seasons. Except for a line-stepping victory against the season championship team, Durant failed to stay on the court. What a memorable achievement. Including the year of recuperation, the four years of his peak period are equivalent to lying flat and ""lost"", which can be said to be a great harm to the accumulation of honors of historical stars. It is difficult to find someone who takes responsibility for the Nets' failure. Du, Ou, and Ha all had health problems. Nash's coaching, the chain reaction caused by the epidemic, Giannis's feet taking root, and Irving's interspersed work, this team that started with full resources was torn apart. into pieces. There is probably nothing wrong with Durant saying ""Irving is not a friend enough"", but from the perspective of a team leader, there is nothing to say about the Nets except admitting defeat. The road ahead is not easy either. Durant and Irving have one thing in common. As technical masters, they will leave a special place in the history of basketball. When you see a young man dribbling coquettishly, you will say ""Misty grass, Owen"". When you see a tall, long-armed mid-range shooter, the image of Durant will immediately come to mind. But the difference between Durant and Irving is that he still has the task of historical status, and unlike Irving, he can ignore public opinion and criticism, and both of these things require winning. The Suns may bring victory to Durant, but it can also open up a new topic that makes him ""unresponsive"". Let's assume this is the storyline: The Suns win the championship; but Booker is Finals MVP. Then Durant took to his beloved Twitter account, and the fan opinions he saw were roughly like this: ""Another second champion, what level is Durant's current wave?"" I know, at this moment, you must be thinking, ""FMVP is not valuable, it doesn't matter who gets it as long as he leads the team to win the championship"" and other excuses. The problem is that this trick can be used by others, but it is inconsistent when Durant uses it. As for more complex debates, for example, listing the combined contributions of Durant and Booker in a large sample of seasons does not make much sense here: First of all, although Booker’s attendance rate is not very good, compared with Durant, the younger he is, the probability of making a higher cumulative contribution in a large sample is still greater. Really, compared to this project, no one is likely to suffer; secondly, when you need to cite more than 20 words of evidence to argue with public opinion, it will probably not be effective. Public reviews only look at two things - overall impressions and recent impressions. When the overall impression cannot widen the gap, it is the last few games that determine the reputation. Therefore, FMVP can indeed ""mark"" the winner, because it is the last award of the season. The public has just watched the finals, so they remember this part the most. What Durant has to face is Booker, who can't hold back his anger. In the Suns' 8 regular season games, Durant averaged 26 points per game. In these 8 games, Booker averaged 28.5 points per game. In the playoffs, Durant averaged 29 points per game and Booker averaged 33.7 points per game. In the series against the Nuggets, Booker shocked the league with his supernatural shooting state. Even if you can say that Durant's comprehensive offensive and defensive contributions are not lost, in terms of intuitive impression, Booker is even more explosive this round, and intuitively Impressions are far more decisive than comprehensive calculations on data. Also, Booker is 26 years old and Durant is 34 years old. Time is on the young man's side. While chasing the championship, at the same time, he has to overpower another core member in the team to prevent the noisy public opinion from drowning the achievements. These two things are not easy at the same time. If you are anti-Durant, don't think you can rest assured. Assuming that you are a Curry fan, do you really think that Durant will be the winner after winning a championship without FMVP, which will lead to a lock in logic? Innocent. At this moment, there must be a big fan jumping out of the grass to complete the winning goal: ""If you don't understand, just ask, why can Booker win FMVP when playing with Durant, but Curry can't?"" Look, Durant is shooting while After losing his opponent, he became a gun in the hands of others, killing his former teammates and then himself. This is very similar to his career experience. If Durant has a chance to completely reverse this situation, it can only be to establish a career that belongs entirely to him in the quagmire of the Nets. This was difficult, and Durant didn't insist anymore. He turned around and plunged into another ""two-front competition."" It would be even harder to break away from his identity as the ""strongest mercenary."" From this perspective, it is hard not to regret the past three years, the three years after Durant's rebirth and the wasted years in Brooklyn. Of course, you don't even know who to respond to with such emotions. There are too many factors intertwined in that mess that can't be sorted out. For Durant, who is about to turn 35, jumping off the bus may be the least bad option, but it will not allow him to win the war against public opinion. Objectively speaking, if everything is left to time and the media people who are more willing to ponder the details can sort out the accumulated history, Durant's evaluation will be more friendly. Even among fans and public opinion, regardless of their positions and disagreements, most people highly recognize Durant's strength. If Durant was a person who didn't care about the sound of the Internet at all, he could block social media and just work hard. But Durant is not this kind of person, so no matter what he does, he can always find that the fans have found another angle to attack him, and then pull him into the third front. There is only one way to win this third front: put down the keyboard and become a Buddha with a stick. #nba#Jing Yimo’s Lost Island Durant",,,,NBA,16,84,360,7/28/23 21:21,Weibo web version,"['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/006BeA6Ely1hgcx3cykz8j3386299hdt.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006BeA6Ely1hgcx3cnljwj30xc0migo0.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/ 006BeA6Ely1hgcx3cohdbj30xc0p0q47.jpg']",,

4.93E+15,NbXHL3wEe,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"Today is Ginobili’s 46th birthday. Old topic: If a player is so good - why play sixth man? Answer: Probably, basketball is played by a team of five people. But a basketball game involves more than one team. Historically, most of the sixth men of the year have been combo guards: either with the body of a shooting guard or the skills of a point guard (Ginobili, Harden, and also Crawford). Either the size of a point guard, the heart of a shooting guard (Lou Williams, Barbosa, Clarkson, Ben Gordon and Eric Gordon). Then there are the swing forwards, famous for their versatility: Jamison, Kukoc, Manning, Odom, and Slimef. There are relatively few centers who have won Sixth Man of the Year, only Bill Walton and Harrell. Probably, great sixth men are mostly versatile, and most of them - compared to their competitors in the starting lineup who are not as talented as them - are strong offensively and weak defensively. Cooper and Walton are rare exceptions. The reason for the term ""sixth man"" is that in 1958, the Celtics' chief forward Heinsohn had excellent abilities, but he loved to smoke and had poor physical fitness. Cardinal Heinsohn's playing time allows Frank Ramsey, the team's most versatile outside player, to start early. When the media exaggerated that Ramsey was just a substitute player, the coach said: ""What substitute? Ramsey is the sixth man on our team!"" - Ramsey is 1.91cm tall and was a forward in college (averaging 15 points and 11 rebounds per game) 3 assists), the NBA can be a guest defender, and his free throw ability is better than Ginobili. Tiger balm. The picture is a bit of a panacea. The purpose of hitting the sixth man is to use strengths and avoid weaknesses - to be precise, to use offense and hide defense. Take Lou Williams, for example. When he was in Philadelphia, Iguodala lamented, ""How can a guy with such a genius on offense be so bad on defense?"" Many combo guards - with the body of a point guard and the heart of a shooting guard - are strong in offense and weak in defense. , able to get a lot of one-on-one ball rights. If you let him play as a starter, it will not be easy to adapt; if you play him as a substitute, everyone will fight, and they are invincible: Lou Williams, Clarkson, Eric Gordon, Jason Terry, and even the microwave oven of the old Pistons. From a team perspective, some people are placed as the sixth man for offensive and defensive opportunities. For example, we all know that from 2014 to 2019, the Warriors' strongest lineup was the five-player team that played in a hurry. But always use Bogut/Pachulia as the starter? Most teams like to use a large lineup to play against each other in the opening game, which is called setting the tone. Because the game started, everyone was full of energy and clashed with heavy armor. Kobe had a quarrel with the Sharks and was not willing to pass the ball to the Giants for a time; but later when he was doing his own show, the reason was very clear: - Early in the game, you need to show your presence in the paint and hit the basket. ——In the early stages of the game, attackers should not stick to the ball and should pursue fast and concise attacks to activate the entire team and detect the opponent's defense. This is also the reason why many teams start more cautiously and use a large lineup. After fighting for a while, everyone's physical strength was reduced. Everyone took off their armor and started fighting with bare hands. The sixth person was added. Therefore, the most effective inside combination for the Lakers in the 2008-10 season was Gasol + Odom, but Bynum had to be used in the starting lineup. They would rather use Odom as a substitute: because Bynum had to carry the weight. Therefore, the most beautiful offense of the Bulls in 1995-98 was mostly played by Cole + Jordan + Pippen + Rodman + Kukoc, but Harper and Longley would still be used in the starting lineup: because Longley had to carry the weight. It's like the Five Death Warriors are invincible, but Bogut/Pachulia always have to do the heavy lifting in the opening game. The sixth person has a sharp blade. It is easy to curl the blade when fighting with heavy armor at the beginning, and his moves are fatal when fighting with bare arms. Iguodala was the de facto sixth man of that Warriors team, changing the rhythm as soon as he stepped on the court. Speaking of rhythm... The Cardinal later used Havlicek as the sixth man. Havlicek was physically invincible and played crazy fast. The opponent couldn't stand it. ""We are all running out of breath, and none of them can survive?!"" This Switching rhythm functions, many sixth men have it. In 2005, Popovich expressed his feelings about Ginobili. When he first watched Ginobili play, he thought it was incredible, ""How could he be so crazy?"" But then, when he understood that ""everything Ginobili did was to win,"" he understood and even let it go. During the 2005 Finals, Popovich said this: ""Ginobili plays too aggressively and too aggressively. Most players only get tired after playing for 8 to 9 minutes, but the intensity of his game will make him tired after 6 minutes."" He exhausted his energy within minutes; that’s why I considered letting him come on as a substitute and completely destroy the opponent with his rhythm.” When Ginobili came on the bench, the Spurs started with Parker + Duncan, with an extra shooter at the 2nd position (Bruce Ginobili). Lunt Barry, Roger Mason, Danny Green) and the like; Parker and Duncan digested the ball and the whole team played defense; Ginobili came out to lead the second team, attacking like fire, and the opponent's rhythm was disrupted; finally At the end, Ginobili played with Parker and Duncan. This was the Spurs' three-piece set at the time: defensive first team, hot second team, perfect ending. The Thunder later used Harden as the sixth man, with a similar idea: the Spurs started with Parker + Duncan, and a 3D shooter could be used at the 2nd position. The second team was commanded by Ginobili, and all three players came out at the end. The Thunder started with Westbrook + Durant, with Sofolosa at No. 2. The second team was commanded by Harden, and all three players came out at the end. In the 1980s, the Lakers used Cooper as the sixth man, and they would fight for defense and counterattack from the beginning; the Celtics used Bill Walton as the sixth man, and they would block the opponent's confidence in the inside. A look at the 1986 Finals Parrish couldn't stop Big Dream, so in the second game, Walton was heavily used to carry Big Dream. In the 1990s, the Bulls used Kukoc as the sixth man, and they focused on the lateral transfer and interspersion of the triangle offense. In the fifth game of the 1998 Finals, Kukoc made 11 of 13 shots, most of which were obtained through empty cuts. The Jazz were caught off guard: they defended Jordan, Pippen, Cole's cold shot and Rodman's offensive rebound. They didn't expect the Bulls to use Kukoc as a center. Picture Before 1984, the Celtics' basic structure was two guards + Bird + Maxwell + Parish. Maxwell himself admitted it: he attacked the basket and guarded the small forward; Bird attacked the outside and guarded the power forward. McHale is the sixth man: because he has a slight overlap with Bird, and Bird criticized him in the early days, thinking that he was invincible from behind, but his ball was not as fast as Maxwell. Later, Maxwell left and the Celtics changed their backcourt - Dennis Johnson + Ainge - so McHale started: he guarded the perimeter and attacked the basket; Bird continued to guard the power forward and play freely. Before 1983, Bird's average assists per game did not reach 6. After McHale replaced Maxwell, Bird's assists per game directly increased to 7 per game, and his three-point field goal attempts doubled. This is adjustment and adaptation: when McHale is the sixth player or a starter, Bird can change his style of play and produce results. Let’s talk about it again, Ginobili. Ginobili entered the industry and won the 2003 championship as a substitute for Stephen Jackson. He began to start in the second and third grade. In the third grade, he and Parker played against the Sonics and were considered by McMillan to be ""two point guards interspersed."" But in the 2006-07 season, the Spurs' second team was short of players, and Finley and Barry could serve as the No. 2 position. So in January 2007, Popovich asked Ginobili to substitute. After being a substitute for several years, in the 2010-11 season, the Spurs began to use passing and cutting to speed up the game, and Ginobili became the starter again. In the summer of 2011, the Spurs brought in Leonard and Danny Green. The starting hole was filled, and Ginobili became the sixth man to lead the second team. This is what Ginobili is like: whenever the team's structure changes and someone is needed to take care of the first team, he will go; if someone is needed to take care of the second team, he will come. He didn't care whether he started or not, and even asked to come on the bench. In turn, to a certain extent, Popovich has always doted on Ginobili. In Game 7 of the Spurs' loss to Dallas in 2006, Ginobili made a fatal mistake, and the old man continued to use him the next year; in Game 6 of the 2013 Finals, Ginobili had a terrible performance of 9 points and 8 turnovers, and the old man continued to use him in the next game. Keep him in the starting lineup. The most typical story: In January 2007, the Spurs' record was unstable. Popovich ran to find Ginobili. An average player would probably say: ""I was on the best team of the 2002 and 2006 World Championships, the ace of the 2004 Olympic champion team, and almost became the MVP of the 2005 Finals. Why do I have to come off the bench?"" Ginobili He said: ""You want me to come on the bench, right? I can't wait!"" So he returned to the bench. After some adjustments, in early February, the Spurs won a mighty 13-game winning streak, and then won him five years in the industry. Third NBA championship. Finally, the sixth person also scored. As mentioned above, many sixth men with beautiful statistics are essentially lone wolf players: Lou Williams, Clarkson, Ben Gordon, Jason Terry. Probably for them, playing means, ""Okay! I can start scoring freely again!"" Pictures and the sixth man of those championship teams-Ginobili, Iguodala, Bill Walton, Kukoc - Many are golf geniuses. He has the ability and has indeed served as the team commander. So people like Ginobili, Iguodala, and Kukoc are more like: ""It's too humiliating for you to be a role player in the first team. How about giving you command of the entire second team?"" And they will answer like this: The game is about to begin, and I will be a substitute from now on until death. I will not compete for the starting spot, I will not steal the limelight, and I will not be vain. I will not wear a crown or compete for honors. I will do my duty faithfully, live and die. I am the sword on the bench and the soul of the second team. I am the flame that changes the rhythm, the light that connects the moments, the horn that wakes up my teammates, and the shield that protects the team. I dedicate my life and glory to the sixth man. It's like this tonight and every night. #Ginobili##NBA##六人#",,,,"Ginobili, NBA, Sixth Man",44,34,261,7/28/23 16:14,Weibo web version,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hgcoqxg393j31kd1kw4pq.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hgcorhn5acj3069098t8u.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 005ztwqOgy1hgcorpp49dj30m80eq7ca.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hgcos33genj30m80e7tdp.jpg']",,

If there is no player like Morant on the earth, I may like Fox after Westbrook gets old and retires (actually, he still likes him now) like). I made a Fox video last month (O web link), which basically explained it in detail. Fox is a fast defender with extremely fast straight-line breakthroughs. There may only be two or three people in the league who can compare with him in speed. Fox is very good at playing pick-and-rolls, attacking the frame fiercely and taking a lot of free throws; he has a strong competitiveness and desire to win; he is a big-game player. 23 The Kings are a three-dimensional offensive team full of shooters, multiple ball handlers, and the league's second-best inside organizer Sabonis, which just allows Fox to take advantage of his strengths and avoid his weaknesses. As he got what he wanted, he moved away from his position as a pure scorer and became the league's strongest player in key shots and the first winner of the annual Critical Moment Player Award. 23 Fox's two-point shot is the only one in his career that is effective. His control at the basket is that of a top center. He has excellent touch near the frame. He can stably score points with mid-range shots when the center retreats. His stability is quite exaggerated. His mid-range ball-handling and shooting with confidence and skill shined in the playoffs, making Fox unsurprisingly the Kings' best player and leader in the playoffs, averaging 31+6+7+2.5 per game before breaking his hand. At the end of the game, there was only an open three-pointer by Barnes to lead the defending champion 3-1. Fox may not be as strong as he seems at critical moments in the regular season and in the playoffs, but the 23 Kings are a typical team suitable for Fox. He and Sabonis get along well with each other and perform their duties. It is the first time the Kings have re-entered the game after 16 years. An absolute hero in the playoffs.

Please stay tuned, Lao Yang will definitely have something to tell! Today we will continue to talk about the two games. Please like and follow and support Lao Yang. League: Sunday 006 Time: 07-23 21:00 Team: Solna VS Malmo Age: 10 years old, 11 years old, 22 years old Suggestion: The first game is Solna and Malmo in the Swedish Super League. Malmo has lost its top spot in the last two consecutive defeats, its morale has dropped, and injuries within the team are also serious. Six players, including captain Christiansen and main defender Vecchia, are unable to play, and main striker Trin has not recovered. The best state, offensive state and defensive line are a bit worrying. Solna's form has improved recently. They have won two games in three rounds and are about to jump out of the relegation zone. There is no doubt about their fighting spirit. Facing Malmo, who is full of injured soldiers, I believe Solna can defend their home court. League: Sunday 009 Time: 07-23 23:00 Team: Sanafee VS Bode Shine Age: 01 years old, 02 years old, 12 years old Recommendation: Lose The second game is Sanafee and Borg Shine of the Norwegian Super League. Sanafee has been winless in the last four rounds and is in a sluggish state, especially their defense, which is as thin as paper. Bode's shining offensive power is very strong. The team's twin stars Pellegrino and Persia have jointly contributed 23 league goals. They are the most powerful combination in the entire league. Although this game is a guest, they are facing the state. There is no problem for the sluggish Sanafee to win easily. League: Sunday 013 Time: 07-23 23:30 Team: Kalmar VS Varberg Age: 10 years old, 20 years old, 21 years old Recommendation: Win the third game of Kalmar and Varberg. Varberg is currently the worst performing team in the Swedish Super League, with only one win, five draws and eight losses. The team has only scored 11 goals so far in the league. Their offense is stretched to the limit. At the same time, their defense is also full of loopholes, both offensive and defensive. None are as good. Although Kalmar has suffered a losing streak recently, its hard power is still much higher than that of Varberg, who is in last place. This game is at home, so it should not be a big problem to win against Varberg, who is in a sluggish state. . NBA game updates are in the video and top workbook.

4.93E+15,NdkfccOUU,2131257231,The sun is so cool,"#体育##NBA# After Curry entered the NBA in 2009, he was isolated by the team boss without playing a single game. The reason was not only that Ellis did not want the team to select the point guard, but also that Curry and Curry A temperament that doesn’t fit in with the team’s atmosphere. At that time, Golden State still had the gangster spirit of the Golden State Gang, and many players on the team were very repulsive to Curry, who came from a wealthy family. Even Warriors Saint Jackson once said in an interview that Curry said that some people are born with a silver spoon in their mouth. , but I lost my mother when I was a child, so maybe we are not the same person. In order to ease the relationship with his teammates, he deliberately controlled the number of shots and did his job conscientiously. On October 26, 2009, Curry learned that it was the birthday of the boss Ellis. After training, Curry volunteered to find the coach and said that he was good at singing and asked him to sing happy birthday to his boss. So a scene like this appeared, where an exaggerated and off-key birthday song came from the mouth of an immature primary school student. The originally pleasant birthday song turned into a devilish sound. Alice held the cake and looked at Curry in disbelief. He never expected that the rookie who was rejected by him would take the initiative to celebrate his birthday. Although he took the initiative to show his kindness to his teammates, Curry was still the target of bullying by the whole team at this time. , but Curry is using his own way to gain recognition from his teammates bit by bit, but after all, basketball is still a sport that uses the ball to speak. Only when you perform on the court will others look up to you. In the first month of Curry's rookie season, his performance was decent, averaging 9.8 points, 5.5 assists and 1.3 steals per game. As Ellis suffered more and more injuries, Curry gradually gained more and more possession of the ball. The sharpshooter who shined in the NCAA was finally able to show his true strength. On January 23, 2010, in the Warriors' game against the Nets, when Ellis was not feeling well, the baby-faced boy stepped up and made 11 of 21 shots, scoring 32 points and 7 assists, and led the team to defeat the Nets. . Ellis never imagined that this little rookie contained so much energy. In the game between the Warriors and the Clippers on February 10, 2010, Curry broke out again, scoring 36 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists, getting his first career triple-double. The powerful offensive power shown by the rookie Curry made the players defending him Unexpectedly, the final schedule then deepened, Ellis was out of action many times due to injuries, and Curry got more opportunities to perform. Before this, people had never thought that there was such a player who could change the game with three-point shooting. At the end of the season, the Warriors achieved a record of 26 wins and 56 losses, but Golden State fans were full of hope because Curry, a rising star in the league, was about to set sail. In the offseason of 2010, new boss Lacob took charge of the Warriors. After the slogan that brought the Warriors to the ranks of the best sports clubs in the United States, the Warriors fired head coach Nelson this season and promoted assistant coach Smart to serve as interim agent. As the head coach, they also introduced All-Star big man David Lee, and selected Udo and Jeremy Lin in the draft. The Warriors' changes are obvious, and their goal is to break into the playoffs. However, because Smart prefers to use Ellis, Curry's playing time has been compressed. At the same time, the atmosphere within the Warriors is also very tense. In November 2010, a female Warriors employee sued Ellis for sexually harassing her over a three-month period. As soon as this news came out, it caused intense discussion among the outside world. In this case, the Warriors management made a decision that could change NBA history. In the 2011-12 season, Curry was plagued by injuries. More importantly, these injuries occurred without confrontation. Curry fell into a cycle of injury, recovery, and comeback. He only played one game throughout the season. After 26 games, he was even called a glass ankle by the outside world. Rumors of trading Curry have always been heard, but after examining Curry's injury, the Warriors management determined that there was no structural damage. They chose to offer Curry the famous child labor contract in the future, worth 44 million for four years. Ellis has exploded this season, averaging 24.3 points and 5.6 assists per game. The incompatibility of the two's playing styles, coupled with Curry's injury, has made the Warriors consider trading Curry. So before the deadline of the trading day, the Warriors reached a deal with the Bucks. The original target of the deal was Curry, but unexpectedly, the Bucks did not choose Curry because of his injury risks. Instead, he chose Ellis, who was in hot form, so Curry was forced to stay in Golden State. After Ellis left the team, Curry completely became the absolute core of the team. After Ellis was traded, the Warriors and Bucks met again, and Curry hugged Ellis in greeting. Many years later, Curry picked up the microphone again and again at Oracle Arena to build momentum for the home court and speak for himself, but he will definitely remember that when he was a rookie, he also used the microphone to sing for team boss Ellis. That birthday song. At Ellis' wedding, he only invited two NBA stars, and Curry was one of them. In the last game of the regular season at Oracle Arena, the entire Warriors team wore jerseys from the Golden State Gang era. Before the game, Curry put on the No. 8 jersey of former boss Monta Ellis and walked into the arena easily. , although the combination of the two did not bring victory to Golden State, it brought more hope. At that time, people would not have thought that Curry, who had been plagued by injuries, could grow to such an extent, and no one would have thought that Thompson, Ellis's younger brother, who served as a substitute for Ellis that year, would create with Curry what kind of legacy belongs to the Warriors. era.",,,,"sports, NBA",0,0,0,8/6/23 15:28,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/laarge/6cb4d36dly1hf3cw2ir4uj20Hs0amq3i.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/6cb4d36cw2jb5ij20H20H20H20H20H20H20H20H 20H s0b3aao.jpg ',' https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 6cb4d36dly1hf3cw2kcb6j20hs09pwff.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/6cb4d36dly1hf3cw2j4jej20hs08njs5.jpg']",,

4.93E+15,Nb39DsJDl,1740825602,I am like fire,"#体育##NBA# After Curry entered the NBA in 2009, he was isolated by the team boss without playing a single game. The reason was not only that Ellis did not want the team to select the point guard, but also that Curry and Curry A temperament that doesn’t fit in with the team’s atmosphere. At that time, Golden State still had the gangster spirit of the Golden State Gang, and many players on the team were very repulsive to Curry, who came from a wealthy family. Even Warriors Saint Jackson once said in an interview that Curry said that some people are born with a silver spoon in their mouth. , but I lost my mother when I was a child, so maybe we are not the same person. In order to ease the relationship with his teammates, he deliberately controlled the number of shots and did his job conscientiously. On October 26, 2009, Curry learned that it was the birthday of the boss Ellis. After training, Curry volunteered to find the coach and said that he was good at singing and asked him to sing happy birthday to his boss. So a scene like this appeared, where an exaggerated and off-key birthday song came from the mouth of an immature primary school student. The originally pleasant birthday song turned into a devilish sound. Alice held the cake and looked at Curry in disbelief. He never expected that the rookie who was rejected by him would take the initiative to celebrate his birthday. Although he took the initiative to show his kindness to his teammates, Curry was still the target of bullying by the whole team at this time. , but Curry is using his own way to gain recognition from his teammates bit by bit, but after all, basketball is still a sport that uses the ball to speak. Only when you perform on the court will others look up to you. In the first month of Curry's rookie season, his performance was decent, averaging 9.8 points, 5.5 assists and 1.3 steals per game. As Ellis suffered more and more injuries, Curry gradually gained more and more possession of the ball. The sharpshooter who shined in the NCAA was finally able to show his true strength. On January 23, 2010, in the Warriors' game against the Nets, when Ellis was not feeling well, the baby-faced boy stepped up and made 11 of 21 shots, scoring 32 points and 7 assists, and led the team to defeat the Nets. . Ellis never imagined that this little rookie contained so much energy. In the game between the Warriors and the Clippers on February 10, 2010, Curry broke out again, scoring 36 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists, getting his first career triple-double. The powerful offensive power shown by the rookie Curry made the players defending him Unexpectedly, the final schedule then deepened, Ellis was out of action many times due to injuries, and Curry got more opportunities to perform. Before this, people had never thought that there was such a player who could change the game with three-point shooting. At the end of the season, the Warriors achieved a record of 26 wins and 56 losses, but Golden State fans were full of hope because Curry, a rising star in the league, was about to set sail. In the offseason of 2010, new boss Lacob took charge of the Warriors. After the slogan that brought the Warriors to the ranks of the best sports clubs in the United States, the Warriors fired head coach Nelson this season and promoted assistant coach Smart to serve as interim agent. As the head coach, they also introduced All-Star big man David Lee, and selected Udo and Jeremy Lin in the draft. The Warriors' changes are obvious, and their goal is to break into the playoffs. However, because Smart prefers to use Ellis, Curry's playing time has been compressed. At the same time, the atmosphere within the Warriors is also very tense. In November 2010, a female Warriors employee sued Ellis for sexually harassing her over a three-month period. As soon as this news came out, it caused intense discussion among the outside world. In this case, the Warriors management made a decision that could change NBA history. In the 2011-12 season, Curry was plagued by injuries. More importantly, these injuries occurred without confrontation. Curry fell into a cycle of injury, recovery, and comeback. He only played one game throughout the season. After 26 games, he was even called a glass ankle by the outside world. Rumors of trading Curry have always been heard, but after examining Curry's injury, the Warriors management determined that there was no structural damage. They chose to offer Curry the famous child labor contract in the future, worth 44 million for four years. Ellis has exploded this season, averaging 24.3 points and 5.6 assists per game. The incompatibility of the two's playing styles, coupled with Curry's injury, has made the Warriors consider trading Curry. So before the deadline of the trading day, the Warriors reached a deal with the Bucks. The original target of the deal was Curry, but unexpectedly, the Bucks did not choose Curry because of his injury risks. Instead, he chose Ellis, who was in hot form, so Curry was forced to stay in Golden State. After Ellis left the team, Curry completely became the absolute core of the team. After Ellis was traded, the Warriors and Bucks met again, and Curry hugged Ellis in greeting. Many years later, Curry picked up the microphone again and again at Oracle Arena to build momentum for the home court and speak for himself, but he will definitely remember that when he was a rookie, he also used the microphone to sing for team boss Ellis. That birthday song. At Ellis' wedding, he only invited two NBA stars, and Curry was one of them. In the last game of the regular season at Oracle Arena, the entire Warriors team wore jerseys from the Golden State Gang era. Before the game, Curry put on the No. 8 jersey of former boss Monta Ellis and walked into the arena easily. , although the combination of the two did not bring victory to Golden State, it brought more hope. At that time, people would not have thought that Curry, who had been plagued by injuries, could grow to such an extent, and no one would have thought that Thompson, Ellis's younger brother, who served as a substitute for Ellis that year, would create with Curry what kind of legacy belongs to the Warriors. era.",,,,"sports, NBA",0,0,0,7/22/23 16:17,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/laarge/6cb4d36dly1hf3cw2ir4uj20Hs0amq3i.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/6cb4d36cw2jb5ij20H20H20H20H20H20H20H20H 20H s0b3aao.jpg ',' https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 6cb4d36dly1hf3cw2kcb6j20hs09pwff.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/6cb4d36dly1hf3cw2j4jej20hs08njs5.jpg']",,

4.93E+15,NaRQby45L,3288577881,_Meow Mamba,"[Miaokan Sports Issue 6 - ""Ghost Brother"" Reddish] Signing: The Lakers signed Reddish this summer with a two-year minimum salary contract to once again improve their forward reserves. Reddish is nicknamed ""Ghost Brother"" and is a god. It is common to see ghosts in every game. He is a static talent with a height of 2.03 meters and a wingspan of 2.15 meters. He is a standard forward figure and has explosive athletic ability. As the No. 10 pick in 2019, Reddish’s talent is visible to the naked eye, but his golf intelligence Not high, and his extremely unstable performance on the offensive end has led to him changing teams frequently. This time with Zhan Mei leading the team, and the Lakers' overall defensive system being solid, Reddish has the opportunity to complete his transformation with the Lakers. Advantages: ① Excellent defensive potential. Compared with Hachimura, Reddish has a longer wingspan and faster foot movement, and the effect of switching defense to the outside is better. Compared with Biao Ge, he has a stronger body. This It also makes him more confrontational in the third and fourth positions and has a higher defensive ceiling. In the new season, he must improve his defensive awareness and judgment of the ball on the court next to Zhan Mei. ② Extremely high athletic ability. As a standard forward player, his explosive power, jumping ability and coordination are all at the upper-middle level. In terms of static talent alone, he has unlimited imagination and can often do some amazing things in the game. The actions of gods. Disadvantages: ① The shooting is extremely unstable, and he is even called the ""ice shooter"". This also causes Reddish as a striker to affect the team's space on the court, and is unable to pose a threat on the outside, causing the opponent to shrink its defense. ② Insufficient ability to handle the ball, extremely low golf IQ, vague sense of position on the field, frequent mistakes on the offensive end, affecting the overall team's offensive rhythm, and when the offense does not go well, the willingness to defend will also decrease. ③ Progress has been slow. From being a strong contender for the top three in the draft back then, to now, in three years, the progress in terms of offensive skills, on-field awareness and on-field performance has been almost zero. What everyone sees is still the explosion of talent in the draft."" ""Duke's Three Elites"", but now they still only have talent. At least for now, the training potential is not high. Cephalosporin said: ""Scratch a lottery ticket with a basic salary, the upper limit is George and the lower limit is Qiao Feng, no matter how you look at it, it will not be a loss.""

I was more tired than going to work and more tired than running a marathon. I will no longer be allowed to watch table tennis matches in the future. The viewing experience is really mediocre, especially since the ticket I bought is for the 3rd floor stand. I can only overlook the stadium, but there is no obstruction. I can clearly see the matches on each table, but I don’t have that many pairs of eyes, so I can’t only watch one table of games at a time. I can only feel the atmosphere. It feels pretty good when the whole audience is cheering for the Chinese team. But after watching it for a while, I feel very tired because I need to keep my eyes wide open to see clearly the ball coming and going on the field, not to mention the expressions of the athletes. , I can’t see clearly with my 1.5-inch eyes, so I can only look at the big screen above. In fact, it’s no different from watching TV, and the screen above is quite small when viewed live. In short, the viewing quality is really average. The key is that the ticket for the third floor costs 480. How can I justify this price? It can only be said that I can watch many games, dozens of games, because there are so many stations on site, which can accommodate simultaneous games. 480 is enough to watch at least 3 Phoenix Mountain football games, but it’s a pity that tickets to Phoenix Mountain are not available. We now know what the inside of the sports center, which has been mysterious for several years, looks like. If you don't watch football, you probably won't have the chance to go inside. I heard that this venue is equipped with NBA standards and can also hold basketball games. It is a pity that it was turned into a table tennis game from the beginning.

How likely is it in your opinion? Gu Zhenyu: It is definitely possible, but any approach that directly applies the previous logic is definitely not the optimal solution. The optimal solution is definitely to appropriately transplant experience, and the rest should be adapted to local conditions. For example, TikTok is a very good place for celebrity marketing. Because TikTok’s creators are more capable of producing cool and fun content than YouTube and Facebook, and are more suitable for short-term cultivation and conversion, the experience of Douyin and Xiaohongshu can be transplanted very well. But some forms, such as live broadcast, may not necessarily be effective. This is not a problem of the platform or the operator. It is more a matter of local conditions and depends on the living habits of mainstream European and American users. In Europe and the United States, it is difficult to develop the habit of obtaining information through live broadcasts and consuming them on live broadcasts. In China, the establishment of a retail system has been skipped to a certain extent and went directly to e-commerce. Europe and the United States have a very complete offline retail system. Even if you live in a very empty county, you still have your own shopping mall area, and it is a chain of retail channels with very rich stocks, so consumers will have more choices. Including Douyin e-commerce can quickly become a national thing in China, also because the distribution of everyone's online time is relatively similar, but in Europe and the United States, NBA games, baseball and other entertainment or time-consuming channels will be more abundant.

During the 2008-09 season, Garnett tore the ligament in his right knee and played in and out until he was reimbursed for the season. This season he played 57 games, averaging 31.1 minutes per game, 15.8 points, 8.5 rebounds, 1.2 blocks and 2.5 assists. The team that lost Garnett was eliminated by the Magic in the second round of the playoffs, and the Celtics failed to defend their title. This season Garnett was selected to the All-Star team for the 12th time, but withdrew from the game due to a groin strain and was selected to the first-team defensive lineup for the 8th time. In the 2009-10 season, Garnett returned from injury, but his condition declined significantly, averaging only 14.3 points and 7.4 rebounds. But the Celtics came back and reached the Finals for the second time in three years. That year, the Lakers defeated the Celtics 83-79 in a life-and-death battle and won the NBA championship with a total score of 4-3. In the following years, the Celtics failed in the early rounds of the playoffs and failed to reach the finals. On June 28, 2013, the Nets traded Garnett and others from the Celtics, and the era of the Celtics' Big Three officially came to an end. On March 14, 2022, the Celtics officially announced that they would retire Garnett's No. 5 jersey during the home game against the Mavericks.",,,,,0,0,1,7/31/23 14:53,NBA Super Talk,['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006JJGs8ly1hgg3b6nuc0j30et0fp769.jpg'],,

4.93E+15,NcnaTmMSY,7224834454,Ball-blind discussion of heroes,"[Reprinted translation] About the Mavericks and Capela Based on their offseason goals before entering the summer and the results they have been able to achieve so far, the Mavericks' offseason can be described as quite successful. The Mavericks re-signed Kyrie Irving as their top priority, acquired versatile defensive forward Grant Williams in a sign-and-trade, reunited with sharpshooter Seth Curry, and on draft night Acquired Derek Lively II and Olivier Maxanse-Prosper, and the rest of the team looks pretty solid in comparison. However, the biggest omission from the Mavericks' offseason roster is their failure to acquire their desired mature starting center. NBA insider Marc Stein hosted his radio show ""The Saturday Stein Line"" on 97.1 The Freak on Saturday, where he answered listener questions, including one lingering on Dallas' hopes of acquiring Atlanta Hawks center Clint Capela. ""The Mavericks don't want it to end here. Maybe they have no interest in this lineup anymore because they have made no further moves,"" Stein said. ""If there was an opportunity to trade Clint Capela from the Atlanta Hawks, they would be very happy."" Stein added: ""So far, we have reached the end of July and the Mavericks have not gotten that opportunity. But, will Atlanta What about a three-way trade where Capela joins the Mavericks?"" As Stein pointed out, Dallas and Atlanta discussed a Capela trade during the NBA draft, and the Mavericks ultimately rejected the Hawks' offer. Trade demands for Josh Green or Jaden Hardy. However, if the Mavericks feel they have reached the end of the road when it comes to an upgrade at center that might be what they need to catapult themselves into a true championship contender, a Capela trade should remain on their to-do list items on the list. ""Would the Mavericks like this opportunity? Yes, they would,"" Stein said. The offseason continues, training camp is approaching, and we will wait and see if the Dallas people can make one last adjustment to their roster before the official start of the 2023-24 season. #mffl#",,,,mffl,0,1,9,7/31/23 9:05,mavschina super talk,,,

Kobe said to the person sitting next to him, 'Hey, he seems pretty good.' It's the best thing in the world. Kobe is recognizing your game."" Recalling the moment when Kobe slapped his butt: ""It was a preseason game, and Kobe just showed his Mamba mentality. He led me all over the game, and he He was always in front of me, and I thought to myself, what is going on, this is Kobe. He kept close to me, and after about 4 or 5 slides, he bumped into me, causing me to lose my balance. I was very tired at that moment , I just wanted to get back into shape in the preseason. But he went all out and he was much stronger than me. After I lost my balance, I had no choice but to shoot."" ""It was a super long three-pointer, and I made it. , I acted very calmly, as if nothing had happened. This was facing Kobe, and I had to try to stay calm. During the process of returning to defense, he slapped me on the butt, and I later pushed him. I had to defend myself. At halftime, I immediately ran back to the locker room to ask for the video."" On if he had been recruited by other famous basketball schools: ""The results would definitely be different. I might have to play as a substitute for a year at other schools. No. Like at Davidson, there are so many opportunities to play. In addition, Davidson's system helped me achieve my current success."" ""If you go to a famous school, your resume will definitely look better. People like Lillard and Morant, no matter where they go, Either way, it will definitely shine. I won’t change my experience. I definitely want to play instead of sitting on the bench.” On how golf’s hole-in-one is equivalent to the NBA level: “This is a unique experience. If you compare it to Compared with hitting a three-pointer from 75 feet (the basketball court is 94 feet), I have done this kind of shot in training or games, so I expected the ball to go in. But I didn't do it in golf. After the ball went into the hole, I lost my mind. , sprinted 139 meters, ran to the hole to celebrate, I almost fainted. Unless it was a 75-foot three-pointer in the NBA Finals to win the championship, I would not celebrate like that."" On the difference between the NBA now and in the past: ""The main thing is The intensity of the confrontation is different. In the past, the games were tougher. But the main reason is that the space on the court is different. In basketball in the 1990s, nine players might be inside the three-point line, and five or six players in the paint. My dad would tell me He hit a buzzer beater in Madison Square Garden when they were double-teamed in the paint and passed to him on the strong side. I've never seen anything like that in the past 12 years. The game has changed so much, but The main thing may be related to me. By the way, there is also the player contract in the end, haha."" On the advice for people who practice shooting: ""The most important thing is the elbow. You have to keep it as vertical as possible. It cannot be turned in or out, or turned out. It is the most common, so that you cannot maintain a stable arc and the power of the shot. The elbow should be at 90 degrees when taking the shot. I believe this is something that most people can replicate. Elbow valgus is definitely a taboo when shooting. ""For ordinary people, Klay's movements are easier to replicate. His balance, from the position of his feet to the movement of his shot, is perfect from all angles. If I want to teach someone who has never shot a basketball before, When someone shoots a basketball, I ask him to imitate Klay's posture. The great shooters in the history of the league all have different movements and shooting postures. If you take a photo of Klay shooting, that movement is definitely the most beautiful I have ever seen. ""On the players you imitated when you were a kid: "" Steve Nash and Reggie Miller. Miller is a master of running without the ball to create shooting opportunities. I can't imitate his shooting movements, but with his movement, he can always get open to catch and shoot. I just want to combine the playing styles of Nash and Miller. The funny thing is, Seth and I would imitate Alonzo Muning's free throw process, wipe off the sweat, take two shots, wipe off the sweat again and shoot.

The only drawback may be that the heel is too low, giving the illusion that the heel will fall off (it is recommended to take a size smaller or wear basketball socks for practice) 💥🧊Cushioning: The midsole is blessed with technology. I am 170cm and 116 pounds, and I can feel it in actual combat. The cushioning effect is particularly obvious, and it protects ankles and knees very well💥🧊Grip: The outsole is designed with rubber outsole➕cross pattern, and this pattern is thicker than other sneakers, which brings benefits The anti-slip effect is very good, basically you can hit it wherever you point. At the same time, the wear resistance is also very good. I played for 3 hours in one afternoon and there was no obvious burr. Size: It is recommended to go half a size smaller, or wear basketball elite socks to play. The heel fall and integration will be more obvious. 💥 Seven stories‼ ️respect this pair of sneakers as a ""must go out"" #mlb老肖##mlb#🔻As a pair of classic shoes that everyone says is a ""must go out"", the AJ3 ""White Cement"" will be officially released in the near future. While maintaining the OG design, the shoe as a whole is injected with oxidized distressed details, giving it the same visual effect as the recently re-engraved AJ1 ""Chicago"". 🔻The color scheme of the original white cement is restored as a whole, retaining the delicate texture of lychee leather and matching the classic crackle design on the toe, which is full of retro temperament. In terms of details, the classic NikeSwoosh and old heel design highlight the classic OG elements. A white distressed midsole paired with a gray outsole completes the design of the entire pair of shoes. 🔻Although it has been reported on the Internet that the workmanship of the shoes is poor, it does not affect everyone's love for it. In one sentence, ""If you go out, you must go in!"" aj[topic]##nike[topic]##aj3[topic]##The most versatile shoes[topic]##Must-have money[topic]##Stick to love[topic]##Unboxing of sneakers[topic]# #WHAT TO WEAR TODAY [TOPIC] # @NIKE # I want traffic [TOPIC] # It’s a pity that the shoe cabinet does not have this pair of shoes #aj6rouge red # Super awesome (I only have one number correct, don’t be deceived) ""Why Can’t you miss the black and red six this time?” How classic is the re-engraved Air Jordan 6 “Infrared” this time? I think as a die-hard Michael Jordan fan, it is impossible not to know that this pair of sneakers was produced by Michael Jordan in the 1990-1991 season. Defeating the shoes worn by Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers, he won his first NBA championship and started the Bulls' first three-peat dynasty. So, with the addition of championship attributes, are these sneakers dazzling? We speak for ourselves. The super classic mid-air layup came from that year's NBA Finals. Although this pair of Air Jordan 6 ""Infrared"" has been re-released in 2010 and 2014, it may sound slightly inferior to the re-release this year. Although the black and red Air Jordan 6 reissued in 2014 was spurned by shoe fans because of the ""pink"" color scheme, it was still sold out quickly after its release and soared to a price of 3,000+ on the secondary market. However, in the past two re-engravings, the classic ""Nike Air"" words were not displayed on the heel position of the shoes, so this is the perfect return version after 19 years of re-engraving in 2000. And you ask me what NikeAir represents? If you think back to how popular the AJ4 white cement heeled by Nike Air was in early 2016, you will understand. Counting this release in 2019, this pair of classic shoes has been released a total of 6 times. Recently, NikeSNKRS also released a comparison between the old and new, allowing us to understand the evolution of the black and red Air Jordan 6 in detail. Let’s take a look at what details have changed in this latest pair of re-engraved sneakers. If you look carefully, you can see that the 2019 model not only brings back the Nike Air heel, but is also closer to the original OG in terms of details. In addition, the breathable holes on the shoe body also continue the 3M reflective details of the 2014 re-engraved model, which brings a good trend element to the entire pair of shoes on the basis of being very low-key overall. Furthermore, combined with the extraordinary texture brought by its own nubuck leather shoe body, the appropriate benefits of infrared red details, and the attributes of being easy to match in terms of wearing, and having a super high degree of reproduction of the OG model, it is already a perfect shoe based on its own conditions. Quite excellent. Not only that, this time Air Jordan 6 Black Infrared also launched children's shoe sizes, allowing your children to wear these Jordan championship boots. It is worth mentioning that this black and red AJ6 is also very conscientious in terms of sales volume. It can be said to be comparable to the ""AJ11 Concord"" to a certain extent. All friends who like AirJordan6 ""Infrared"" can purchase it at the lowest original price! Full of sincerity! Finally, what surprises can there be about the black and red AJ6 that has been reproduced several times? I think that by restoring the OG style to the greatest extent, shoe fans can feel the wonderful game in 1991 and the excitement of Michael Jordan winning the first NBA championship. This alone is satisfying enough. As for this priceless sentiment and belief, is it worth recharging? I believe there is no need to think too much.",,,NIKE,"aj1 barb 5.0, barb 5.0, aj1 lightning barb, barb black warrior, ts barb 3.0, what fragrance to wear today [topic], note inspiration [topic], SNKRSKickCheck [topic], daily life of shoe control [topic] ,AirJordan1[topic],TravisScott[topic],Barb[topic],sneakers on feet[topic],daily wear[topic],daily wear[topic],shoe control’s daily life[topic],barb[ topic], barb low-top [topic], Aj1 [topic], WDYWT [topic], OotD [topic], SOULGOODS [topic], why we love sneakers [topic], on-foot wear [topic], Li Ning marshmallow , China Li Ning, mlb daddy shoes, mlb, these can’t beat you [topic], aj [topic], nike [topic], aj3 [topic], the most versatile shoes [topic], a must-have [topic] , stick to love [topic], sneaker unboxing [topic], I want traffic [topic], aj6 rouge red",0,0,0,8/3/23 18:30,iPhone client,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/008jCXGtgy1hgjqf3n7lsj31ji1xe7oi.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/008jCXGtgy1hgjqf4bnhdj31hs12faq3.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/ 008jCXGtgy1hgjqf2vnqbj31h8121wq9.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/008jCXGtgy1hgjqf68uqhj31hn12bqm8.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/008jCXGtgy1hgjq f7hg48j31ji1xe4qp.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg. cn/large/008jCXGtgy1hgjqf82impj31hd124dpd.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/008jCXGtgy1hgjqfbb6ejj30wi1yckjl.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/008jCXGtgy1hgjqf dw90jj30wi1ychdt.jpg', 'https:// wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/008jCXGtgy1hgjqfedjhxj30v91oiqbo.jpg']",,

He said he also wanted to go. The annual salary offered by the Saudis to Mbappe shocked the world. 700 million euros a year is too exaggerated. . This not only proves how wealthy Saudi Arabia is and can spend so much salary to buy this genius, but also proves how optimistic and appreciative they are of Mbappe. Even if they only sign for one year, even if they can move to Real Madrid freely after the contract expires, they are still willing to take advantage of them to deal with the embarrassing situation between Paris and Mbappe. Paris is naturally 100% willing to such a proposal. They have already approved Saudi Arabia's transfer quotation application through official channels, which is the share of 300 million euros. It's just that Mbappe is still thinking about it, and he has not expressed any position on the offer from the Middle East. You must know that we often say that for a star, if he joins a wealthy league to make money, he can avoid more than ten years of detours. Mbappe's reported annual salary of 700 million euros in one year is not only Save yourself a few years of detours. Even if calculated based on the super-top salary of 70 million euros per year (when Cristiano Ronaldo was at Real Madrid), he has avoided a decade of detours. Therefore, the temptation for Mbappe is still very great. It is reported that he and his family, that is, the brokerage team, are thinking about how to deal with joining the Middle East. Maybe, this really seems to be an impossible option, but it becomes the only possible option. Of course, supporters around the world and superstars from other sports also expressed surprise. For example, Antetokounmpo, a well-known basketball player from Greece, jokingly said on his social media that he looks very similar to Mbappe. Should the Saudis consider offering themselves a similar annual salary? The Suns' shooter Payne also expressed his views on his social media. After calculating Mbappe's salary of 700 million yuan a year, he can earn as much as 2.1 million yuan a day, which makes him very envious. of.

4.93E+15,NdjC2aso9,5663148673,Lao Yang's extreme backwards,"Lao Yang posted the video yesterday. Did your friends watch the game? Lao Yang has been playing games with the director for many years. He often uses tricks such as pretending to be a pig to eat the tiger, making a big move, and having a head-to-tail battle to upset the opponent. Please stay tuned, Lao Yang will definitely have something to tell! Today we will continue to talk about the three games. Please like, follow and support Lao Yang. League: Sunday 006 Time: 08-06 19:00 Team: Leicester City vs Coventry Age: 10 years old, 20 years old, 21 years old Recommendation: Win the first game of Leicester City and Coventry. After Leicester City was relegated, although they lost their core midfielder Madison and top scorer Barnes, they bought Tottenham midfielder Winks and Everton defender Coady in the summer window. The defense line is To further improve, Coventry let go of their absolute power in Uccles. The two newly introduced forwards were mediocre in strength and did not help much on the offensive end. This game gave Leicester City a first-class start. We can believe it. League: Sunday 012 Time: 08-06 21:30 Team: Leeds United vs Cardiff City Ages: 20 years old, 21 years old, 32 years old Recommendation: Win the second game of Leeds United and Cardiff City. Although Leeds United lost their top scorer Rodrigo, they basically retained the main lineup from last season in other positions, and did not lose much strength. In order to strengthen the team's offense, Cardiff City directly introduced four forwards in the summer window. However, judging from the preseason games, these four players have a very average run-in with the players and have not even integrated into the team. The field is more optimistic that Leeds United can win the game. League: Sunday 017 Time: 08-0700:00 Team: Sunderland vs Ipswich Age: 11 years old, 22 years old, 01 years old Recommendation: Win the last game between Sunderland and Ipswich. Sunderland almost succeeded in reaching the Premier League last season, but unfortunately lost to Luton Town in the play-offs, resulting in a fall short of success. They have no signings or reinforcements this season, and their strength has not changed much. As a newly promoted team, Ipswich is really not afraid of tigers. It drew with Luton and defeated Leipzig in the pre-season. This performance is still very good. This time the match director gave the two teams a zero start. I I feel that Ipswich, who are in better condition, can escape unscathed. NBA game updates are in the video and top workbook. Since the time is earlier, the changing data may affect the results.

After Harden left, Gordon's two years in the Rockets were not very good, but his level was good. He stopped shooting three-pointers so crazily, his passing became better, and he silently took over the difficult matchups on the outside. This season Gordon can basically be divided into pre-trade and post-trade. Before the trade, he started every game, and his three-point shooting basically remained unchanged except for his three-point shooting, which dropped from last year's career high. Later, he went to the Clippers to play as a substitute, and his three-point shooting improved again, but the Clippers had too many perimeter players who could hold the ball. Even Plumlee had to hold the ball for half the game. Gordon's offensive role with the ball has significantly declined, and he has returned to his position as a catcher and three-point shooter. The frequency of three-pointers has returned to the period when he was partnered with Harden in a small sample. In terms of production efficiency (the Clippers took 7.3 shots in 36 minutes and hit 42.3%), it was quite good, and the openings were very stable. But when the Clippers lost two core players in the playoffs, Gordon failed to replicate his previous playoff performances. He only averaged 10 points per game when he started every game, and his efficiency was also very low. He might be really old. However, in the Suns, he returned to the substitute role, relying on his more specialized positioning, he is still a good role player.

Please refer to this link directly for the content of the interview: O Web Link Regarding this interview, some defenders believe that Russell spends almost all the time talking about teammates. You just Is it interesting to single out this half minute? On the contrary, I think that he is 27 years old and has learned to speak polite words to become more like a normal person. During this interview, he was obviously very emotional, as if he had been wronged a lot. It is self-evident which emotion is true between grievance and politeness. So my judgment is: he must feel that he has been wronged this season. He is obviously playing well, but his annual salary is almost cut in half, which makes him feel that he has been wronged. been treated unfairly. Of course, this emotion should not be directed at his teammates, but just a complaint that no team in the league offered him a contract. This just reflects the huge difference in values between him and this team. From Russell's point of view, it was his arrival that brought the Lakers out of the quagmire. Not only did they reach the playoffs but also defeated the Warriors. Not only did all indicators in the regular season reach career highs, but his performance in the playoffs also exceeded his career. At any time, so even if he lost to the Nuggets, he still described his second cooperation with the Lakers as a ""complete success""; but from the Lakers' perspective, there is no success without a championship. The Lakers are currently in the playoffs. All his performances only represent the hope of success, just hope. Unfortunately, the biggest distance between hope and success is Russell. In fact, before this interview, as early as 2016 , he had a more abstract interview: this year’s playoffs, next year’s finals (pictured). This means that the young Russell had no idea of the dangers of the NBA and liked to set goals far beyond his ability; but now Russell, after several years of social beatings, his expectations for himself are more realistic. He has matured. It is precisely because of this maturity that it highlights the difference in values between him and this team. His abilities and ambitions cannot meet the requirements of the Lakers. Success is never achieved overnight. If the Lakers want to achieve the ""success"" they define, Russell is destined to be just a footnote next to success. This is why the Lakers forced him to give up his right to veto trades when the contract was signed. Perhaps it would be better for both parties to part ways in the near future.",,,,,1,120,349,8/3/23 16:47,Weibo web version,['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/65cabec4gy1hgjn78i0vrj20fg0bm44f.jpg'],,

Most people’s distracting thoughts are: Am I doing this right or wrong? Did he do this right? What will he think of me if I do this? There is a core concept here, that is, most people are too obsessed with right and wrong, always distinguishing between right and wrong, good and bad. Most people are always calculating whether this thing is useful to them. The final calculation is whether they are good or not? Calculate how others will treat you? Everyday fears, worries, and anxieties come from it. I am afraid that if I do not do well in the eyes of others, it will bring so-called negative effects to myself. Using a set of standards instilled in society to measure oneself and others is like many people who have been saying that they want to come out of tz, but their parents and people outside have advised her not to come out. I have been entangled and unable to extricate myself from the calculation. The real misdirection is when you break away from the so-called right and wrong, beyond the binary opposition. There is no right or wrong, there is only happening, only phenomena. All the decisions you make today are a long-established phenomenon, and then the logic of thinking defines it as the so-called right and wrong, right and wrong, great gains and losses. It may seem like you made a smart decision, but in fact you didn't do anything, it was all arranged. The pain and distracting thoughts are that we are always weighing the pros and cons, judging our own rights and wrongs, and the rights and wrongs of others every day. We are immersed in it, but you don't have an answer at all. Because they are all made up by my own mind, and the editor has been calculating for a long time. What should happen will happen again, and it has nothing to do with personal decisions. Enlightenment through meditation is not to find the right path, nor to find the highest unified standard, but to be free from ""right and wrong"". There is no fixed law. The law here refers to all phenomena. There are no so-called necessary rules in this world, they are all defined by human beings. There is no absolute right or absolute wrong, everyone is different. Different fates, different birth environments, different circumstances, and different family backgrounds. You can't use the same standard to fit everyone perfectly. If we use this set of standards of right and wrong to measure everyone, problems will arise. The moment you let Lang Lang go to the NBA to play basketball, the situation becomes unwinnable. If Yao Ming insists on practicing Rachmaninoff every day, his neighbors will definitely complain about the noise every day. Some children may just not be suitable for studying. If we have to use a set of standards to force them, then the so-called ""bad children"" who ""disobey and don't work hard"" will appear, and disharmony will appear. No one has anything wrong, everything is created differently. The problem is that if we have to cut out the so-called right and wrong, then we will move from the whole to the part and lose all the beauty. Get rid of all these separate thoughts and open your heart to accept everything in this world. Naturally, you will become more and more gentle and tolerant, and more and more loving. No longer judge the mistakes of the world, everything will become particularly harmonious, and the mind will naturally be peaceful.",,,,,0,0,0,8/3/23 23:10,Weibo speed version,,,

Although there is no target yet, the Hornets, Bucks, Raptors, Heat and Suns are all interested in him. Looking at this list of potential destinations, ranging from play-offs to playoff teams to championship contenders, it says something. Sumner is a thin shooting guard who was sidelined for the entire season last season due to an Achilles tendon injury, but made a strong comeback with the Nets. He is so fast that some fans even called him ""the fastest first step in the league"" under his highlights on YouTube. With such speed, Sumner is certainly a player who likes to break through. He ranks third in the same position in 36 minutes of basket shots this season (only behind Gidi and THT), with a shooting rate of 60%, combining production and aggression (career A new high of 5.2 free throws in 36 minutes, with a shooting percentage of over 91%) can be regarded as a unique player. But in addition to Sumner's lack of offensive threat when attacking the frame, his finishing near the frame is a mess. His three-pointers dropped from 40% in the 21 season to 36%, and his grasp of open shots is not fatal; he almost never makes mid-range shots. On the defensive end, Sumner can steal with his long arms, but is limited by his poor size and the high number of fouls.

Garrick Barr, who founded Synergy, has a coaching background. He pioneered the integration of the analysis department with scouting/video analysis in the Suns, mainly to formalize the data collected manually by previous coaches. He left the Suns to set up a company to provide teams with scouting analysis reports. Later, Synergy combined the original scouting analysis report with only text and data with video editing to provide better scouting reports. The first NBA client wasn’t even the Suns, but the Miami Heat. Now when talking about Synergy from the perspective of data analysis, the highlight is indeed the segmented PlayType (most of the time no one mentions it). However, the PlayType category has not changed much. The original framework was designed by Barr for coaches from a scouting perspective. It combined video analysis with basic statistics to allow users to easily obtain a simplified scouting report. More and more subdivisions also allow users to get more detailed information. However, it is always a drawback to only record the end of possession and relatively simple efficiency/effectiveness data, not to mention the potential problems of manual annotation. In fact, SecondSpectrum does a better job and is more expensive (the name is also longer, so it is not well-known and no one mentions it). In short, compared to tactical analysis and technical actions that are complex and full of jargon, the data provided by Synergy is very user-friendly and easy to understand.

Shandong finally won the championship, but due to unsatisfactory rankings in the physical test and technical evaluation, it only finished second. Everyone has pointed the finger at the ""old problem"" of physical testing. Let’s talk about the physical test first. Why physical testing? It’s because our country calls it a professional league, but it’s not really professional. Friends who know football know whether the players are professional enough. It turns out that as soon as the offseason comes, the players who are holding the iron rice bowl start to herd the sheep, so the policy of physical testing was introduced to urge the players to train during the offseason. If our domestic players were as hard-working and professional as NBA players, physical testing would be meaningless to the CBA. I think the professionalism of CBA players has improved to some extent, but it is not big enough because CBA has not completely gotten rid of the iron rice bowl nature. For youth team players, especially athletes in the U-series competition, they are not professional players. It is not a bad thing to have good physical training and technical training. It will be helpful for future career development. That is why the U17 competition is so Pay attention to physical testing and technical evaluation. And to be honest, don't pay so much attention to U17 results. After reaching the first team, the physical test does not count. You are still good. The champion is the champion, and the results are the last word. Compared with the physical test, I think it might be more reliable to modify the scoring rules for the total score. Don't forget (number of teams - ranking) * 0.75. In this way, the difference between first and second place is 0.75. The direct weight of the championship is the same as the weight of the runner-up. The effect is immediate. The current point rules make me see the feeling of the original salary slip.

It’s not about teaching children that it doesn’t matter if they don’t win, lose, or fall flat. On the contrary, the core of this book is to tell children this important truth: You don’t have to win every time. But the most important thing is to learn how to win. It only makes sense to face failure if you know how to win. If you know how to win and face failure, you will not be frustrated or complain, but expect, be excited, and eager to return to the game of life. This picture book may seem inconspicuous, but it was actually written for children by John Maxwell, a famous American leadership expert and speaker. West Point Military Academy, NBA (Basketball League), and NFL (Football League) often come to this old man. Go give lectures. Every child wants to win in a game, but what should he do if he doesn’t win? Every child will encounter this problem, such as a test, an extracurricular activity, or a school competition. Are you frustrated, complaining, and yelling after losing? Will this allow him to return to the game? In this picture book, two children go from being ""frustrated"" when they are unable to face failure at the beginning, to ""feeling solid"" after calming down and training hard for their own progress, to ""calm"" feeling proud despite defeat, and eager to try again. The ""expectation"" when entering the arena, the ""gratification"" when defeat finally turns into victory, and the ""belief"" in one's own efforts are all the epitome of the arena of life. In fact, whether it is impatience, fear of difficulty or loss, pride and face-saving, these are all emotional manifestations of children trying to solve problems on their own without finding the right solution. But this story can be used as a reference for children, and it is very good to give them a reassuring answer. Suitable for children aged 3-7 years old, and very cheap, only a dozen yuan.

Does this mean James made a mistake in founding the school? Or does she think $1.4 million per year is too little? James School wants to do two things: first, let the children go to school and continue to provide tuition after they are admitted to college. Second, provide employment opportunities for parents of children. This barbecue girl is still in the 12-year compulsory education in the United States. Who says that if you have compulsory education, you will definitely be able to start school? We also have compulsory education, but many children still cannot go to school. Otherwise, what is the purpose of so many people establishing Hope Primary School? Of course, everyone can afford to go to school, but the problem is that in an environment like Ohio, there are so many people who don’t want to go to school. The appeal of James School can make some people go to school. Moreover, James School provides tuition for college. How can you say that everyone can afford college? This school has indeed given more people the opportunity to study. In the environment of the lower-class black people in the United States, it doesn't matter whether they are good at studying or not. Rubbish is just rubbish. To put it simply, you can see that there are many black people in James School. Take my school as an example. My school is not very top, it is only ranked among the top 100 goalkeepers in the world. Anyway, there are not many black people in the school. It is as simple as that.

Usually I have too many distracting thoughts in my heart, and I really want to calm down. Most people’s distracting thoughts are: Am I doing this right or wrong? Did he do this right? What will he think of me if I do this? There is a core concept here, that is, most people are too obsessed with right and wrong, always distinguishing between right and wrong, good and bad. Most people are always calculating whether this thing is useful to them. The final calculation is whether they are good or not? Calculate how others will treat you? Everyday fears, worries, and anxieties come from it. I am afraid that if I do not do well in the eyes of others, it will bring so-called negative effects to myself. Using a set of standards instilled in society to measure oneself and others is like many people who have been saying that they want to come out of tz, but their parents and people outside have advised her not to come out. I have been entangled and unable to extricate myself from the calculation. The real misdirection is when you break away from the so-called right and wrong, beyond the binary opposition. There is no right or wrong, there is only happening, only phenomena. All the decisions you make today are a long-established phenomenon, and then the logic of thinking defines it as the so-called right and wrong, right and wrong, great gains and losses. It may seem like you made a smart decision, but in fact you didn't do anything, it was all arranged. The pain and distracting thoughts are that we are always weighing the pros and cons, judging our own rights and wrongs, and the rights and wrongs of others every day. We are immersed in it, but you don't have an answer at all. Because they are all made up by my own mind, and the editor has been calculating for a long time. What should happen will happen again, and it has nothing to do with personal decisions. Enlightenment through meditation is not to find the right path, nor to find the highest unified standard, but to be free from ""right and wrong"". There is no fixed law. The law here refers to all phenomena. There are no so-called necessary rules in this world, they are all defined by human beings. There is no absolute right or absolute wrong, everyone is different. Different fates, different birth environments, different circumstances, and different family backgrounds. You can't use the same standard to fit everyone perfectly. If we use this set of standards of right and wrong to measure everyone, problems will arise. The moment you let Lang Lang go to the NBA to play basketball, the situation becomes unwinnable. If Yao Ming insists on practicing Rachmaninoff every day, his neighbors will definitely complain about the noise every day. Some children may just not be suitable for studying. If we have to use a set of standards to force them, then the so-called ""bad children"" who ""disobey and don't work hard"" will appear, and disharmony will appear. People with strong fire and earth insist on losing weight. They may lose half the weight and still be very fat. No one has any problem. All things are different in nature. The problem is that if we have to cut out the so-called right and wrong, then we will move from the whole to the part and lose all the beauty. Get rid of all these separate thoughts and open your heart to accept everything in this world. Naturally, you will become more and more gentle and tolerant, and more and more loving. No longer judge the mistakes of the world, everything will become particularly harmonious, and the mind will naturally be peaceful. #四叶宝我#",,,,"Fourth Master bless me, Fourth Master bless me",60,31,285,8/3/23 16:42,iPhone 14 Pro,,,

When Kobe and I were teammates, he was about to retire. I sat in the same row with him on the plane. He didn’t talk to anyone. He was writing the story and preparing to direct the movie. Wherever he went, everyone would change. Very quiet. Kobe had decided to retire that year. Our team basically had one-year contracts. There were only 3 or 4 young people on the team talking about former teammate Poole. Russell said: I didn’t expect him to get a big contract. He's my little brother, he reminds me of myself... I didn't expect him to be as good as he is today. I remember we compared him to Hiero, and I thought Hiero might be better than him. You can see his potential, he has good skills, he can play without the ball and he can handle the ball by himself, and Curry and Klay will also coach him. Talking about the Nuggets, Russell said: Their team has the best players in the world, and there is no disrespect to others, but Jokic is currently the best player in the league, and no one can compare with him. When asked about his feelings about returning to the Lakers again, Russell said: I can say that I only played for three teams instead of four, which is interesting because at the time the Lakers were in a vortex of public opinion, it was like The Lakers were being ridiculed because of the failures they were experiencing, so to me it was like bringing a new energy to the team and we made everyone there smile again. Then we had a great run and then got a chance to make the playoffs, which we did, and we made it to the Western Conference Finals. I know we ended up losing to the championship team, but I was happy enough with what we accomplished. excited. Beverley said: There are really very few teams that can do this. You defeated Stephen and the Dream-Chasing Warriors in the playoffs, but people rarely talk about this. Talking about the series with the Warriors, Russell said: I personally think that the Warriors are a team that you can never rule out because Steve Kerr is a basketball scientist and their entire coaching staff is a scientist. , they will work out some different lineup combinations to achieve their goals. When you have LeBron and AD and some other guys, it's going to be very tough for them to play against us, just like we're worried about them. Before entering this series, I was thinking that they had to find a way to defend us. Before, we had been thinking about how to defend them, how to slow down their rhythm, how to stop them, how to make them miss shots, but It's also hard for them to stop us. Talking about the Lakers in the new season, Russell said: I know we have a lot of players who can play. What contribution each person can make to the team every night will be our focus. I may be in a certain game. You need to score, and in another game you need to give out eight assists, you need to provide assists for Reeves in the corner, and everyone has to play the right basketball. If each of us commits to this, the sky is the limit. Whether it's Reeves or Rui Hachimura, these guys can have winning performances and we need to make sure we get to the playoffs and make sure we pick up where we failed and nothing else matters. Talking about being traded multiple times, Russell said he had been traded four times in his NBA career and said he ""could feel it"" when the trade came and observed the way the gatekeepers treated him when he walked onto the court.

League: Thursday 003 Time: 08-04 08:00 Team: Flamengo vs Olin Asunción Age: 20, 21, 32 years old Recommendation: Win against Flamengo After the new coach Sampaoli took office, the offensive firepower It has increased significantly. They have been unbeaten in 10 games in all competitions recently, scoring 19 goals. The average number of goals per game is even close to two goals. Their defense is also relatively stable, and they have only conceded six goals so far. Their home results are very good, with no defeat in ten home games. Sampaoli also rested most of the main players in the last round. Although they fight on multiple fronts, there is definitely no problem in terms of physical strength. Olin Asunción has been frustrated in the domestic arena this season. Recently, it has suffered a wave of five rounds without a win, and its overall state is relatively sluggish. Their biggest problem is that this season's coach's tactical system is relatively chaotic. The team has no absolute core and everyone wants to go it alone. Moreover, head coach Arce is also quite stubborn and insists on irregularities in the intensive schedule of four games in ten days. There is a big physical risk. This game is an away game, so it is difficult to guarantee the condition. Flamengo, who is at home, should be able to win. League: Thursday 002 Time: 08-03 18:00 Team: Morocco Women VS Colombian Women Age: 1 goal/2 goals Suggestion: Let’s beat the Moroccan women’s football team, which is ranked 72nd in the world. The overall strength of the team is average. In the group stage, After 2 games, they achieved 1 win and 1 loss. They are currently ranked third in the group stage with 3 points. They are 3 points behind the Colombian women's football team at the top of the list. At the same time, they are consistent with the German women's football team, which is third in the standings. The team has been ranked third in the group stage in the past 10 years. They achieved 2 wins, 2 draws and 6 losses in all competitions. In the last Women's World Cup away game, they defeated the Korean Women's Football Team 1-0; this is the third time the Colombian Women's Football Team has participated in the World Cup and is currently in the group stage. After winning 2 games in a row, they ranked first in the group stage with 6 points, 3 points behind Germany: the team had 5 wins, 3 draws and 2 losses in the past 10 games in all competitions. In the last game The away match of the Women's Football World Cup defeated the German Women's Football Team 2-1; we are still optimistic about a small pattern in this game.

Usually I have too many distracting thoughts in my heart, and I really want to calm down. Most people’s distracting thoughts are: Am I doing this right or wrong? Did he do this right? What will he think of me if I do this? There is a core concept here, that is, most people are too obsessed with right and wrong, always distinguishing between right and wrong, good and bad. Most people are always calculating whether this thing is useful to them. The final calculation is whether they are good or not? Calculate how others will treat you? Everyday fears, worries, and anxieties come from it. I am afraid that if I do not do well in the eyes of others, it will bring so-called negative effects to myself. Using a set of standards instilled in society to measure oneself and others is like many people who have been saying that they want to come out of tz, but their parents and people outside have advised her not to come out. I have been entangled and unable to extricate myself from the calculation. The real misdirection is when you break away from the so-called right and wrong, beyond the binary opposition. There is no right or wrong, there is only happening, only phenomena. All the decisions you make today are a long-established phenomenon, and then the logic of thinking defines it as the so-called right and wrong, right and wrong, great gains and losses. It may seem like you made a smart decision, but in fact you didn't do anything, it was all arranged. The pain and distracting thoughts are that we are always weighing the pros and cons, judging our own rights and wrongs, and the rights and wrongs of others every day. We are immersed in it, but you don't have an answer at all. Because they are all made up by my own mind, and the editor has been calculating for a long time. What should happen will happen again, and it has nothing to do with personal decisions. Enlightenment through meditation is not to find the right path, nor to find the highest unified standard, but to be free from ""right and wrong"". There is no fixed law. The law here refers to all phenomena. There are no so-called necessary rules in this world, they are all defined by human beings. There is no absolute right or absolute wrong, everyone is different. Different fates, different birth environments, different circumstances, and different family backgrounds. You can't use the same standard to fit everyone perfectly. If we use this set of standards of right and wrong to measure everyone, problems will arise. The moment you let Lang Lang go to the NBA to play basketball, the situation becomes unwinnable. If Yao Ming insists on practicing Rachmaninoff every day, his neighbors will definitely complain about the noise every day. Some children may just not be suitable for studying. If we have to use a set of standards to force them, then the so-called ""bad children"" who ""disobey and don't work hard"" will appear, and disharmony will appear. People with strong fire and earth insist on losing weight. They may lose half the weight and still be very fat. No one has any problem. All things are different in nature. The problem is that if we have to cut out the so-called right and wrong, then we will move from the whole to the part and lose all the beauty. Get rid of all these separate thoughts and open your heart to accept everything in this world. Naturally, you will become more and more gentle and tolerant, and more and more loving. No longer judge the mistakes of the world, everything will become particularly harmonious, and the mind will naturally be peaceful. #四叶宝我#",,,,"Fourth Master bless me, Fourth Master bless me",0,0,0,8/3/23 19:24,iPhone client,,,

This was the first game against the Lakers in the 2013-14 season when Howard returned to Los Angeles to play for the Rockets after leaving the Lakers. Howard vowed to prove himself in front of Kobe. With 7 minutes and 07 seconds left in the third quarter of the game, the Lakers were already trailing the Rockets by more than 20 points, but with Kobe's paranoia, no one would give up easily. When he and Howard grabbed a rebound again, Kobe stepped forward and tried to snap the ball down, but both ended up losing. Conflicts arose due to excessive movements. Everything happens for a reason. The reason for the conflict between the two was that Howard had a conflict of ideas with Kobe when he was playing for the Lakers. Kobe saw Howard's cynical look, coupled with the sluggish state of training and games, the team's record plummeted again, and he also suggested The Lakers can trade him. At that time, Howard was very disgusted with Kobe. He thought that Kobe monopolized the ball and was an old dog who didn't pass the ball. To say this must be that he was not centered on himself and was unbalanced. After knowing the news that he wanted to trade himself, he was upset. Hate. But Howard came to his senses later. Kobe called himself a softie, not because of his physical weakness, but because of his lack of seriousness in training and competition, his lack of a zero-return mentality, and his immature mind. If Howard could realize this early, he wouldn't have to fight with the big-browed brother because he couldn't get into the top 75 players.

My thoughts were suddenly pulled back to 2017, the year when Durant joined the Warriors to fight against the Cavaliers led by James. At that time, the focus seemed to be on the league's big and small kings. After Durant retired from injury, the Warriors also experienced many ups and downs. Injuries of all sizes were blocking the Warriors' path to the championship. No one seems to be optimistic about such a team in the past few years, even though Klay has returned from injury. , nothing has changed. After being eliminated, when asked by reporters, you said very firmly: No one wants to meet us next season. Finally, in 2022, you led the team to win the championship again, and you finally proved yourself. Only you know the ups and downs along the way. From being underestimated at the beginning, you have now become one of the best scorers in the NBA. , you have completely proved yourself and finally won your FMVP trophy. Where is Curry?

Although the points situation in this group seems simple, all four teams have the possibility of advancing or being eliminated. If the Chinese team wants to advance, in addition to defeating the English team, it also needs to score as many goals as possible to achieve a goal difference advantage. However, facing the England team, which is ranked fourth in the world and is the favorite to win the championship, the gap in the overall strength of the Chinese team is clearly revealed. Less than 4 minutes into the game, England scored with a shot from Alessia Russo, leading 1:0. Subsequently, England's two ""post-2000"" teenagers Hemp and Lauren James broke through the Chinese team's gate one after another.

The first Chinese female singer invited to participate in Michael Jackson's Asia concert. The first Asian female singer to attend the World Cup opening ceremony. The first Chinese female singer to release an all-English album... Baby, your achievements are really dazzling. You work hard and conscientiously and never slack off. You said that compromise is never in your vocabulary and you always work so hard. You can control any style, whether it's fast songs, slow songs, high notes, or rapping, you can control it very well. Your transposition is really awesome. And R&B is in your blood. Your dancing is also really good, your rhythm is really good. Your arrangement is also really great!

You have always said that you are Chinese. You want to bring Chinese music to the world. You want everyone to know that Chinese people are also very good at singing. Boss, you did it! You always present a hot and sexy image, but you are such a traditional person at heart. Sincerity and kindness are most vividly reflected in you. Baby, I hope you are no longer in pain. I hope you are living happily with your father and singing loudly! Oh, by the way, a fan wrote your name in the Sydney sky. You can see it, right? Don't be too proud!

4.93E+15,NcPUPESdh,2566932275,lakers basketball official,"From the moment he joined the Los Angeles Lakers, superstar big man Anthony Davis has been vocal about his desire not to play center full-time. Last season, the roster needed Davis at center, but the front office wanted to add some options that would allow him to slide to power forward at times. The team is still looking to add another big unit, but the one they added this summer is Jaxson Hayes. Hayes, a former lottery pick in 2019, is a very physical big man who can run the ball and finish on the edge while providing some edge protection. However, he hasn't been able to put it all together in four years in the NBA, but the Lakers are hoping they can unlock his potential, preferably next to Davis. In fact, according to The Athletic's Jovan Buha, the Lakers expect Hayes to start at center and play a big role for the team next to Davis in a lineup with two big names: That's before mentioning Jaxson Hayes, who the team expects to start , and played a prominent role with Davis in two big lineups. Of course, when the Lakers won the 2020 NBA championship, Davis primarily played power forward, with JaVale McGee and Dwight Howard recording the majority of center minutes. Rob Pelinka has talked about his desire to replicate that to some degree, which would certainly appeal to Davis. Mitigating the wear and tear on Davis throughout the regular season is a priority, and rightfully so, but starting Davis and Hayes together will have some serious effects on the rest of the lineup. Most notably, it will force LeBron James to play more minutes at small forward and force him to defend one of the opponent's best wings, something he doesn't need at this stage of his career. This will also have a huge impact on the Lakers' spacing, especially if LeBron continues to struggle from 3-point range like he did last season. Likewise, Davis is not a consistent threat from depth. It would be great for Hayes to play a prominent role on this team, as the Lakers desperately needed more size last season, and of course, he and Davis could share the court together at times.

Josh Richardson showed up to Miami Heat basketball training camp Wednesday at Slam's Miami Heat School. events held. He was surrounded by a group of kids who asked him a series of common questions, from how tall and old he was to what position he played on the field. Then came a seemingly ordinary question: ""Who is the best player you've ever played against?"" The answer prompted a noticeable pause. ""It's funny you ask that,"" the guard, who was playing for the Heat again at the time, said with a smile. ""Damian Lillard."" Richardson then detailed the unique skill set of Portland Trail Blazers guard Lillard. Lillard is a player seeking to join the Miami Heat. He is a 33-year-old All-Star with strong offensive ability and deep shooting range. ""That's the truth,"" Richardson said privately of his candor. ""I'm not going to lie."" Lillard's name hasn't been mentioned publicly in Heat circles because of the reality that not only is he committed to the Portland Trail Blazers, but the league has had trouble with the process. Increase scrutiny. Lillard and Richardson's fates appear to be somewhat intertwined. Richardson's jersey number was No. 0 during his previous tenure with the Heat, but now he has been forced to put his decision on choosing a number on hold. In fact, in order to appear before the Miami Marlins game Wednesday night to throw the first pitch, Richardson chose to wear No. 2. ""That's life,"" Richardson said of not having a number at the moment. ""I don't really care. I mean, we don't have a game right now. Once training camp starts, I'll have a number."" Currently, with the uncertainty surrounding the Miami Heat potentially trading Lillard, Richard There is uncertainty about Desen's upcoming role with the Heat. If the Lillard trade fails to materialize, Richardson may be assigned to the bench or behind the starting lineup, which may consist of Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Tyler Hill and others. Lowe, Kyle Lowry and either Kleib Martin or Kevin Love (depending on game needs). If Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra decides to move Herlo to point guard and keep Lowry in the backup role he played at the end of last season, it's possible that Richardson (29) or Martin Started at shooting guard. If Herro or both Herro and Lowry are used as salary-matching in a Lillard trade, it's possible that Richardson could get a chance in a wider rotation or even a starting spot. ""I mean, you know how Spoelstra is, he's like, 'I can put you out there and do anything,'"" Richardson said of not worrying about how the roster or his role will ultimately develop. ""That's what I'm good at. I'm kind of a jack of all trades. ""We had a good conversation beforehand, but I guess we'll have a clearer understanding once the game starts. ""Richardson said that like everyone else, he had no inside knowledge of Lillard's situation. ""To be honest, I was receiving the same news as everyone else out there,"" he said. ""If If something happens, I'll probably hear about it through Twitter like everyone else. ""I'm just focusing on my game, honestly, trying to make sure I'm ready. If something happens, great; if it doesn't, that's okay. No matter what, I think we're capable of competing."" For Chadson, the road back to the Heat was a winding one. He signed a two-year contract with an NBA minimum salary and a player option for the second season. In 2015, Richardson was selected by the Heat with the 40th overall pick, and was subsequently sent to the Philadelphia 76ers on July 6, 2019, participating in the trade that sent Jimmy Butler to the Heat. Then, Richardson was sent to the Dallas Mavericks by the 76ers on November 18, 2020, in exchange for Seth Curry. Then, he was sent to the Boston Celtics by the Mavericks on July 21, 2021, in exchange for Moses Brown. Richardson's trade path continued. He was sent to the San Antonio Spurs by the Celtics on February 20, 2022, in exchange for Derrick White. The Spurs sent Richardson to the New Orleans Pelicans on February 9 last season in exchange for Devonte' Graham. Finally, Richardson signed with the Heat on July 2, 2022. Richardson's salary this season is $2.9 million, which is the lowest salary since the 2017-18 season with the Heat. His salary last season was $11.6 million. ""I mean, of course, everyone wants stability because it's more comfortable,"" he said. ""But, I mean, I don't mind getting a pay check every few weeks because I love playing basketball. So it doesn't matter to me where I play. ""But I love Miami. I love coming back here. So hopefully I play well and things go well. But we'll see.

4.92E+15,Narl9xRrL,5767284631,_Ninaaaa_,"#体育##NBA# Speaking of Christopher Piatek’s name last season, Chinese fans really knew it. But this season Piatek shines in Serie A and becomes one of the top scorers. AC Milan, which has been dormant for many years, seems to have finally seen the dawn of revival. Since the departure of Ukrainian nuclear warhead Andriy Shevchenko, AC Milan has never had a super striker. Now that Piatek has arrived, his wonderful performance of 7 goals in 5 games has made people believe that Milan is really about to usher in a renaissance. AC Milan is a veteran European giant. It was once more glorious than Juventus and Inter Milan. They have 7 Champions League championships, 2 European Cup Winners Cup championships, 18 Serie A championships, and 5 Italian Cup championships. Although AC Milan has not won as many Serie A titles as Juventus, AC Milan's 7 Champions League titles make Juventus envious. The most glorious era of AC Milan was undoubtedly the era of the Dutch Three Musketeers. The seven sisters of Serie A shined in the three major European Cups. At that time, AC Milan defended the Champions League and was well-known in Europe. In 1994, Milan won the Champions League again. At this time, they were comparable to Real Madrid, Bayern, and Liverpool in terms of the number of Champions League titles they had won. They were the most successful football club in the European competition of that era. In 2007, Kaka, known as the proud son of heaven, led Milan to win the Champions League for the seventh time. But no one expected that Milan at this time would be its last glory so far. Kaka began to suffer from injuries, and he failed to find himself again after leaving Real Madrid. Veteran players such as Inzaghi, Maldini, Seedorf and others are increasingly unable to cope with their needs. Milan, reluctant to part with money, has become a nursing home, bringing in unused players such as Robinho and Ronaldinho, and also turning Pato into a nightclub boy. Even Beckham came to Milan for the 2010 World Cup. But Beckham was destined not to be on the World Cup in South Africa, watching the England team fall in front of the German chariot. Piatek comes from Poland, was born in 1995, and is 24 years old. In the 2017/18 season, he scored 21 goals in the Polish top league and ranked third among the top scorers in the Polish top league. At this time, he attracted a little attention. In the summer of 2018, Genoa brought him to Italy for only 4 million euros. Piatek quickly adapted to the Serie A arena and has been among the top scorers in Serie A this season. On January 23, 2019, AC Milan officially announced that it had officially signed Piatek with a transfer fee of 35 million euros. Genoa did a really good job with this business. Piatek has played 6 games for Milan since joining AC Milan. Facing Naples in the first game, Piatek came on as a substitute in the 71st minute but failed to score, and the two sides eventually shook hands with each other 0-0. Starting from the second game after joining Milan, Piatek turned on the scoring mode and scored in 5 consecutive games. He has helped Milan score 7 goals and has become AC Milan's current strongest leg. At 24 years old, Piatek is still very young and has a promising future. He still has a long way to go. He has superstar potential, but he still needs to work harder to become a superstar. The new Polish striker is waiting for him to take over.",,,,"sports, NBA",0,0,0,7/18/23 16:01,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/7EA3385dly1hfzv093O2WHS08R74H.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hfzv0949Z0J20H20H20H 20H20H 20H20H 20H20H 20H20H 20H20H20H20H s0bemyf.jpg ',' https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 7ea3385dly1hfzv0947bkj20hs09xaal.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hfzv096h7bj20gp08vt96.jpg']",,

On July 18, the 2023 Las Vegas Summer League kicked off the finals, against the Cleveland Cavaliers and Houston Rockets. At the end of the game, the Cavaliers easily defeated the Rockets 99-78 and won the final championship of this year's Summer League. It was also the first Summer League championship trophy in team history. Full game data: Specific scores: 14-28, 30-23, 15-28, 19-20 (the Cavaliers are behind). For the Cavaliers, Isaiah Mobley scored 28 points, 11 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 steals and 2 blocks, and won the finals MVP with his outstanding performance. In addition, Travers had 6 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists, Emoni Bates had 19 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists, Craig Porter had 8 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists, and Merrill had 27 points, 4 rebounds and 2 assists. For the Rockets, Whitmore, who just won the Summer League MVP, was in a bit of a slump. He made only 6 of 17 shots and scored 14 points and 3 rebounds. In addition, Darius Days had 3 points and 4 rebounds, Samuels had 7 points, 5 rebounds and 3 assists, and Nate Hinton had 18 points and 10 rebounds. Game review: Before this game, both teams maintained a winning record. In this summer league's best team selection, the Rockets' Whitmore was selected to the first team and was also elected as the MVP. For the Cavaliers, guard Merrill was selected to the first team, and this year's second-round pick Bates was selected to the second team. At the beginning of the first quarter, the Rockets made their first attack. Whitmore's strong kill was blocked by Big Mobley. After that, Mobley successfully opened the Cavaliers' attack with a hook shot. Next, the Cavaliers began to suppress the Rockets. Just after half the quarter, they had already established a 10-point lead. On the other hand, the Rockets' core White Devils were completely frozen and could only rely on Hinton's three-pointers to hold on. At the end of this quarter, the Cavaliers continued their onslaught, and Mobley made 2 foul shots and two players scored in double figures. After a single quarter, the Rockets temporarily led 28-14. In the second quarter, the Rockets' offense improved. After Whitmore made all his first six shots, he finally hit a three-pointer from the outside on his seventh shot. Led by the White Devils, the Rockets' offensive end blossomed more. With the shooter Fletcher Magee on the bench jumping into the net, the point difference has returned to a 3-point gap. But the Cavaliers quickly called a timeout to adjust and got better. Before halftime, Mobley's attack on the basket was still effective and he had already scored 18 points. At halftime, the Cavaliers continued to lead the Rockets 51-44. Changing sides and fighting again, Cavaliers' second-round pick Bates scored 2+1 with a layup, Merrill made 3 of 3 free throws from outside fouls, and both of them also scored in double figures. Mobley scored 22 points with two consecutive tip-ins. At this time, the point difference was also widened to 15 points. In the next game, the Cavaliers did not give the Rockets another chance. With 1:07 left in the third quarter, Merrill hit a three-pointer, and the point difference was widened to more than 20 points. Hinton of the Rockets also hit a layup, but it was only a drop in the bucket in chasing points. Mobley stepped back and jumped into the net. After three quarters, the Cavaliers continued to lead 79-59. In the final quarter, the Rockets were still trying to chase points. Whitmore's layup successfully narrowed the point difference slightly. But in the latter part of this quarter, as Merrill hit another three-pointer, the suspense of victory was completely eliminated. In the end, after the whole game, the Cavaliers easily defeated the Rockets 99-78 and won the final championship of this year's Summer League, which was also the first Summer League championship trophy in team history.

Robinson, who scored 36 points in the Las Vegas Summer League opener, averaged 1.6 points per game in six games in his second summer league. 20.5 points and 8.3 rebounds, shooting 53% from the field and 8 of 21 (38.1%) from beyond the three-point line. Robinson (6-foot-2, 245 pounds) averaged 25.8 points and 9.3 rebounds in four Las Vegas Summer League games while shooting 57.8 percent from the field and 6-for-17 from 3-point range (35.3 percent). ). ""It's been a long wait for him. I know he's very excited and eager to get back on the court and play again,"" Heat assistant coach Malik Allen said during the Heat's final summer league game of the season on Sunday. Robinson said during the interview. ""...He's so attentive on the court from the little things to the strength training, the conditioning work. It's been one of his most disciplined and focused months since the G League season ended and those guys are continuing to work hard in practice. ."" Robinson's next goal is to prove that his performance in summer league can translate into the NBA. He averaged 3.7 points and 4.1 rebounds in 31 limited games last season, spending most of his rookie season with the Heat as a two-way contract player. Robinson was recently promoted from a two-way contract to a standard contract and is expected to be a member of the Heat's 15-man roster. But only $75,000 of his $1.8 million salary next year is guaranteed, and if he's still on the Heat's roster on January 10, his entire salary will become guaranteed. Robinson believes his improved overall game will earn him a more consistent role in his second NBA season, possibly as the backup behind Heat starting center Bam Adebayo. Currently, his main competition for the position is Thomas Bryant, who has played six seasons in the NBA and joined the Heat as a free agent this summer. ""Absolutely, absolutely, I have that expectation,"" Robinson said on ESPN when asked if he hoped for a chance to break into the Heat's rotation this upcoming season. ""I think my ability to stretch the defense, shoot three-pointers, and have the flexibility on the defensive end to be able to come out and help the team will allow me to get a lot of playing time with the Heat this year."" Robinson showed in the summer league His improved three-point shooting ability has been close to 40% in six summer league games over the past two weeks. In his first NBA season, Robinson didn't have many three-point shooting opportunities in the game. In his final season in college, he shot 37 of 105 (35.2%) from three-point range. He shot 0-for-6 from 3-point range in the NBA and 2-for-12 (16.7%) in the G League. However, as an undrafted rookie last year, Robinson has recently made some changes in his skill set in hopes of becoming a more reliable 3-point shooter who can be trusted to make those shots during games. It's part of his behind-the-scenes efforts over the past year to become a better offensive player without the ball in his hands and make up for his perceived lack of top-end athleticism on the offensive end since he played in Frey plays a big role in Snow State's offense. On ESPN, Robinson said: ""In college, I wasn't playing off the ball, so I was more with the ball. Now I'm here, I'm playing off the ball. I'm combining the two, so now it's two That combination is very difficult for defenses to deal with. So I think I've found my niche in the NBA game."" Robinson said his game has slowed down over the past year. His performance in summer league seemed to confirm that, but the challenge now is to prove it in training camp and the preseason and earn a spot in the Heat's rotation. ""Being able to play in the Finals in my first year in the NBA gave me a lot to focus on and learn from,"" Robinson said of his experience with the Heat last season. ""So as my career progressed, this experience helped me adapt to the current NBA style of play.""",,,,,0,0,0,7/18/23 11:47,Weibo web version,['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/008a9CY1gy1hg0wp32hq0j30vo0htac9.jpg'],,

4.92E+15,Nao0ygSp4,1808662905,Huang Liang Yi Meng,"#体育##NBA#The Thunder lost to the Spurs 112-121 on the road. The Thunder's current record is 3 wins and 5 losses, ranking 11th in the league. On November 9, when many teams in the Western Division had games, the Thunder took a break, which means that the Thunder's ranking may continue to decline. The Spurs, after defeating the Thunder, temporarily retained the eighth place in the Western Conference with a record of 5 wins and 3 losses. Therefore, this game is very important for both the Spurs and Thunder. In this former powerhouse conversation, the Thunder's starting three players performed well. They were Chris Paul, Alexander and Gallinari. Paul scored 19 points, 2 rebounds, 5 assists and 1 steal, Alexander had 21 points, 1 rebound and 3 assists, while Gallinari scored a team-high 27 points, plus 5 rebounds, 1 assist and 2 steals, and he had 6 three-pointers. 5 hits. These three core players of the Thunder scored a total of 67 points, 8 rebounds, 9 assists and 3 steals in this game, and also scored 7 three-pointers. However, the strong outburst of these three warriors did not help the Thunder win. Because LaMarcus Aldridge, the core of the Spurs inside, ushered in a strong explosion. He made 19 of 23 shots, 0 of 1 three-pointers, and 1 of 2 free throws. He scored 39 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals, and 1 steal. Comprehensive data on caps. While scoring the highest score in the game, Aldridge also had the highest offensive efficiency in the game. He only missed 3 2-pointers, 1 3-pointer and 1 free throw in the entire game. Aldridge was on fire on the offensive end, destroying the Thunder's paint area. Aldridge turned into a mid-range shooting killer, and he played his strongest game this season. This is the key for the Spurs to win this game. However, in that game, Aldridge's teammate Marco Belinelli almost acted as an undercover agent. Marco Belinelli played 19 minutes today, making 1 of 10 shots, 1 of 5 three-pointers, no free throws, and scored 3 points, 3 rebounds and 1 assist. Belinelli's shooting percentage today was only 10%, and his three-point shooting percentage was only 20%. As the pitcher that the Spurs rely on most on the outside, his performance today was simply a disaster. Belinelli, who took 10 shots, is the player on the Spurs who has taken the most shots besides the three core players of Aldridge, DeRozan and Murray. Due to Belinelli's poor performance on the bench, the Spurs' entire second team did not perform well, but the Thunder's bench opened the score. I have to say that Belinelli's poor touch really almost ruined the game. Belinelli was selected by the Warriors with the 18th overall pick in the first round of 2007, but was traded by the Warriors to the Raptors in the summer of 2009. As a veteran of the Warriors, Belinelli has worked for many NBA teams. Belinelli returned to the Spurs last summer and signed a two-year, $12 million contract with the team. Belinelli is a famous shooter in the NBA and won the 2014 NBA Three-Point Shooting Contest. However, his performance this season has been very sluggish. Belinelli, who averaged only 4.2 points per game, shot only 19% from three-point range. Belinelli set career lows in both scoring and three-point field goal percentage (except in his first season as a rookie). As the Spurs' outside shooter, Belinelli's competitive form has declined severely. Once he is unable to find his touch, the Spurs' record will be greatly affected.",,,,"sports, NBA",0,0,0,7/18/23 7:32,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hfzurlzwezj20hs0b7aar.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hfzurlzo5wj20hs0bit94.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/ 7ea3385dly1hfzurlxpx3j20hr07xjrx.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hfzurm00h1j20hs09xaag.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hfzurm07qhj20hs 0bk74x.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg. cn/large/7ea3385dly1hfzurlyjvpj20hs08vjrx.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/7ea3385dly1hfzurm7ij2j20hs09r751.jpg']",,

4.93E+15,NcQYuHFO,3682999864,Wang MiTao,"The most subjective, extreme, one-sided, and stereotyped ""Baldur's Gate 3"" character creation manual on the Internet. If you have never been exposed to this type of game before, and you were defrauded of 300 yuan just because you saw the video of Sun Bear, this manual is Made for you. Dungeons and Dragons is a notoriously complicated set of rules. You will almost certainly be helpless when faced with 11 races, 12 professions, 6 attributes and 18 skills in the interface. But don’t be afraid, this article strives to use the most efficient method to help you quickly establish an impression and help you successfully enter the game within half an hour. Many race tutorials will start with career introduction, which I think is completely wrong. As a 3D high-definition interactive sun bear simulator, the most important thing is who is lying under the bear, so race and appearance above all else are the first things you should decide. Elf, you are elegant, you are delicate, you are beautiful, you are extraordinary, you are the representative of fragile aesthetics. You can live to be 700 years old, but when you are 200 years old, you will be like a 20-year-old human boy who takes to the streets to gain popularity. -High Elf You live in the city, have fair skin, are good at magic, and look down on your poor relatives in the countryside. -Wood Elf, you are the poor relative from the countryside. -Drow Elf (Dark Elf) You are a relative living underground. Because you can’t get enough sunlight, you have a mental problem. You become evil, extreme, passionate about SM, and call you mom. You hate every race that gets the sun equally. Half-elf: Because elves are so good-looking, only one of your parents is an elf, and the other half is a human who is known as the strongest pile driver on earth. You basically inherited the characteristics of the elves because humans really don’t have any characteristics. Human you. Some people say that humans are the most creative race in the world and have unlimited possibilities, but you know that is actually a polite way of saying that has no characteristics. If anything, humans have a very strong sexual desire, and I'm sure you do too. The bear agrees. Dwarf you are short. You like digging holes and you also like gold. You can’t tell whether you like gold because of digging holes or because of gold. -Duergar You dug so deep that you became a dark dwarf. Your cultural habits are similar to those of the dark elves, except SM. Halfling you are shorter than a dwarf. You like farming. You're called the Hobbit in The Lord of the Rings. Dwarf, you are shorter than the dwarf, but smarter than everyone else. You have a great sense of humor, but unfortunately not everyone shares that. You insist that your IQ is too high and you can tell a joke of three thousand words. Other races cannot keep up with your humor, so you decide to tell it again. Orc you are another masterpiece from Piledriver. Tiefling, if you think that signing a contract with the devil and being injected with genetic genes is considered sleeping with the devil, then you can also consider yourself to be another masterpiece of the pile driver. Dragonborn, I know what you're thinking, but unfortunately, you were born from an egg. Now that the career is over and the easy dirty jokes are over, let’s get down to business. This is still the most subjective, extreme, one-sided and stereotyped job introduction on the Internet, but I promise that there will never be any dirty jokes again (subjective). The main attribute of a warrior: strength or agility. You don’t believe in magic or magic, and you think that the only thing you can trust in this world is your own sword. You wake up every day and practice swinging your sword 100 times. Finally, at level 20, you mastered the Parkinson's magic skill of cutting 8 knives in 6 seconds. Note that if you want to use swords, shields and two-handed giant weapons, you need more strength, and if you want to use bows and crossbows, you need more agility. The main attribute of the priest: Perception. You are tired of curling up in the monastery confessional and listening to the endless nagging of the neighborhood elders and aunts. You have to put on your armor, pick up the mace, and follow the Crusaders at the forefront of the battle. Physically transcend the spread of paganism. The gospel of your Lord. Then you discover that this was already a glorious history two versions ago, and now your mace can’t hit anyone. In the Holy Realm, becoming a priest not only requires you to choose which god you believe in, but you also have to choose your own realm. The concept of domain is equivalent to ""What can you, a god, do?"" For example, you can seek wealth and peace from Mr. Guan. If you serve as a pastor under him, you can choose to help him receive believers who seek wealth or go out to protect people's safety. Generally speaking, the corresponding relationship between gods and realms is limited. There is obviously nothing he can do to ask Guan Erye for marriage, but in ""Baldur's Gate 3"", the restrictions have been lifted. No matter what god you believe in, you can choose all realms. . From a game perspective, the choice of domain is more important than the deity, as it determines part of your abilities. -In the field of knowledge, you are the librarian in the church. You secretly read books when you have nothing to do, so you know a little bit about everything. -In the realm of life, your breasts are big, very, very big. -Natural Domain You're a little confused as to whether you're a priest or a druid, until you find out you can't change. -In the field of light, others are a bit confused as to whether you are a priest or a mage, because you can also throw fireballs. -Storm Realm You especially like Thor. -In the field of trickery, you don’t like those great, bright and correct guys so much that you decide to become the patron saint of thieves, liars and gamblers. -In the field of war, you are a loyal guard of the old version of the priest. Even in the new version, you still insist on wearing plate armor and carrying a war hammer to open the enemy's head. You're so loyal that you wouldn't want to switch classes as a paladin even if you were a half-ass. Rogue Primary Attribute: Agility You are an unruly lothario, a flouter of rules, so you created a character dedicated to breaking them. You have to disguise yourself as a bishop and visit the brothels, you have to use your stealing skills to sneak into the crotch of the town guard, you have to sneak into the cemetery and eat the enemy's tribute, you have to destroy everything in this world that follows the rules. But now you have become the person most familiar with the rules in the whole group. You always keep a rule book with you to check whether it can be regarded as a sneak attack when you cause a flank attack but are at a disadvantage. Mage's main attribute: Intelligence. You are the only profession in the standard version that uses intelligence. After realizing this, the eyes you look at your teammates become full of care. You often fantasize about a social structure built by a mage and his low-intelligence minions, until you are slashed eight times by a passing warrior. I would rather recommend a mage as an entry-level spellcasting profession. This is the only profession among all professions where you can learn new magic by reading books and newspapers. The cost of trial and error is very low. (Everyone else has to upgrade) Barbarian primary attribute: strength secondary attribute: physique. Your chest muscles are so big that you can't wear any clothes. Your adrenaline is five times that of ordinary people, so you don't know what pain is. You didn't even bother to dodge in the face of the attack. You clamped his sword between your pectoralis muscles and swung the ax to blow his head off. Paladin's primary attribute: Strength Secondary attribute: Charisma You are a hybrid of a warrior and a priest, but you accidentally went too far and became the strongest profession. After reading the job introduction, you said, ""Isn't this just a Paladin?"" and countless barrage teachers taught you the difference between a Paladin and a Knight. You won’t feel much difference after listening to it. -Oath of Devotion You are a standard paladin. Your oath is a copy of the virtues of chivalry. -Oath of the Ancients You are the paladin of the rednecks. You live in a tree, and your oath is to get up every day, brush your teeth, wash your face, and say hello to the monkeys and rangers next door. -Oath of Vengeance You think the oaths sworn by other knights are all sissy, so your oath is ""Evil shall be killed!"" Your birthday wish is that everyone who laughs at you behind your back as a middle schooler will die well. -Forsworn One day you failed to keep your oath, and the god got angry and confiscated your divine power. (This is a hidden profession and cannot be selected directly) Druid’s main attribute: Perception that you are the eternal backup tire of this world. In the past, if a team had only one open spot and realized they didn't have a single caster, they would extend an invitation to you. But now this ecological niche is occupied by bards, who can fight, milk, sleep with NPCs, and do the dirty work of rogues part-time. The video of 'til you turn into a bear' went viral on the internet. Ranger Primary Attribute: Agility Secondary Attribute: Perception You are a cross between a warrior and a druid. While your cousin the Paladin is at the top of his game, you're at the bottom of the 12 classes. You are so pitiful, so pitiful that the game designer secretly opened a back door to strengthen you, and even gave you a powerful and explosive career. You are now eagerly anticipating the release of the game, waiting to enjoy the taste of laughing at the crane tail. Warlock's main attribute: Charm. Due to the strange bloodline of your ancestors, you can cast magic without learning. This thing makes all mages hate it. Because you are too talented, you never studied well when you were a child. When you grow up, you cannot understand the magic formulas written by mages. You can only slowly learn from your own blood through upgrading, resulting in fewer spells that you know. But on the contrary, you can adjust and shape these spells according to your own talents. The cost of trial and error for novices playing Warlock is relatively high, and missing powerful magic will make the battle less smooth. Origin of Spells: When a warlock creates a character, he must choose his own bloodline and declare where his spells come from. -Dragon Bloodline: Your ancestors became dragons, so you developed scales like ringworm. -Storm Warlock: Your ancestors destroyed lightning, so now you have become Storm Priest’s biggest challenge on the road to cosplaying Thor, but you didn’t take him seriously at all. What you thought of was Storm. -Wild Magic You have searched through the family tree and still don’t know what happened to your ancestors. This kind of doubt and confusion has been with you all your life. Every time you cast a spell, you may get unexpected chaotic effects, and you may kneel on the ground and beg you not to cast any more spells. teammates. Bard's primary attribute: Charm Secondary attribute: Agility You choose the bard, and everyone smiles meaningfully at you, waiting for you to defeat all NPCs in the game. While you defended yourself by saying that you just love poetry and music, you turned your charm to the highest level and selected friendship, sleep, and charm humans from the spell list. Bards, like warlocks, need to hand-select magic when leveling up. But I know that this difficulty is not worth mentioning for pile drivers. Warlock's main attribute: Charisma You may be a warlock player in World of Warcraft, a loyal reader of ""Faust"", or a representative of Party B. In short, you especially like to sign contracts with others to gain strength, and the joy of getting something for nothing makes you unable to extricate yourself. The warlock's spellcasting rules are very specific, simpler than those of the warlock bard, and there are fewer options when leveling up. The alien sect leader is the same as the warlock. You need to declare who you signed the contract with and where your power comes from. -The contract you signed with the devil decided to become Madoka. -Supreme Fairy You signed a contract with the winged elf and decided to become Kinomoto Sakura. -Old Dominator You are a CoC player who was forced to come to DnD by your friends to make up the numbers. You are excited to find that you can sign a contract with Cthulhu in an aboveboard way without tearing up the card. Monk's primary attribute: Agility Secondary attribute: Perception Everyone thinks you are a fan of martial arts movies, but in fact you are a heavy user of WeChat sports. Your average number of steps per game is three times that of a barbarian, your number of shots is twice that of a paladin's, your steal control is twice that of a bard's, and your damage score is on par with that of a warrior. You believe that with five monks, you can easily win the ""Baldur's Gate"" NBA, but there is no one to help you play. Adding attribute points is a relatively complicated task. Here is the simplest and fastest way to add points. It is not perfect, but it is enough for new players. Note: All attribute values below refer to the final values after calculating racial bonuses. First of all, make sure that the final results of all your attributes are even numbers. This is the most important rule. Then check what the main attribute of your profession is and increase it to 16. If your class has a secondary attribute, increase it to at least 14. The remaining points are allocated to agility and constitution, and spellcasting professions generally add them directly to constitution. The processing of agility as a non-primary attribute is more complicated. First, make sure it is no less than 10, and then check the armor proficiency of your profession and race. If you have heavy armor proficiency, the agility should not be higher than 10, and if you have medium armor proficiency, it should not be higher than 14. Skills & Origin Skills determine your character's abilities outside of combat. Part of it comes from your attributes, and the other part comes from whether you are proficient in it, that is, whether you select it as a proficiency item. Attributes have higher priority than skills, and the points added to primary and secondary attributes are generally not adjusted for skills. Skills generally serve role-playing purposes, so pick whatever you want your character to be good at. If you really don’t know what to choose, give priority to the ones classified under your main attributes. The background setting is also for role-playing purposes, just choose what you like. If it's more utilitarian, just avoid race and origin from repeatedly providing proficiency in the same skill. #baldur's gate3#",,,,Baldur's Gate 3,14211,796,21755,8/3/23 12:04,Weibo web version,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/db861e38gy1hgjf8i3xqkj20cs05z3zk.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/db861e38gy1hgjf9ota50j21z4140k0k.jpg']",,

This is a must-win game for both sides. Needless to say, if the Celtics trail 3-1, they're out and they could fall apart. The Heat cannot lose this game. After the defeat, they will return to Miami in G6 and the pressure will be great! The slightly lacking strength of the Heat should end this series as soon as possible. The Celtics were injured in G5. After falling behind by 9 points in the third quarter, they went on a 16-0 run and reversed the situation with one goal. Tatum took the lead, while Jaylen Brown and Brogdon played through injuries. After the victory in G4, the morale of the ""Celtics"" was also high. Although there has never been a team that came back from 0-3 in the 77-year history of the NBA, there has never been a team that came back from 1-3 in history. In the last 3 games, the ""Celtics"" achieved the final victory. It also instills confidence in them. Bad news comes from the heat. The team's starting point guard Vincent is absent due to injury, and Trump is likely to start. But multiple records show that when Vincent started the playoffs for the Heat, the Heat's record was 18 wins and 5 losses. When Vincent was on the court, he ""hit"" the lead by 34 points, but when he was not on the court, he lost by 12 points. In comparison, the Heat lost by 21 points when Trump was on the court and won by 43 points when Trump was off the court. For the Heat, they lost a very young player. Of course, the Heat still have Butler. Some media posted two photos of Butler with a ghostly smiling face. One is Butler's ghostly smile when the Heat and Knicks lost in G3. The second is Butler's smile during the last round of G4 against the Celtics. Against the Knicks, Butler blew away his opponent in G4.

On a scale of 0-Max of 10, I would give it a 9. He was phenomenal, he was ahead of the curve. Lively would have done the same. He has great potential and will one day become the Mavericks' starting center. O-Max is a 3D player who is very comfortable in transition offense. He is like a bull on the offensive end. He still has to work on his decision-making after entering the paint, but the team and I are happy with their performance. - Dudley We are getting better every game. Every day we are getting better. After the first game, we rallied and won the next four games. For me, I feel like I'm getting a better understanding of the game and the speed of the NBA and getting used to the schedule. As the game went on I felt more and more comfortable on the offensive end and I played to my strengths. As the race went on it slowed down for me. ——Prosper is now an above-average defender defensively. He has size and brainpower. Offensively, he doesn’t try to do too much. If you look at his figure, he is already a big boy. You can imagine him being in the weight room for another two or three years. Now, he's just in the process of learning the nuances. This will take care of itself. He's like a bigger Marcus Smart, given his size, his physique. Marcus Smart has transformed himself into a better shooter. I think he has the ability to defend positions 1 through 4, and I think one day he will be a member of the league's All-Defensive Team. - Dudley (What he hopes to do with the rest of the summer and then enter the new season's pre-season training camp) Just be myself, you can't try to be someone else. - Prosper (What I learned) One of the things is when you play the pick-and-roll, you have to slow down and make the right reads, and then defensively, I have to defend better and know where I'm supposed to be, Executing a defensive strategy, those are the two most important things. I feel like they (Liveley and Prosper) both played well in summer league and they have to build on that. They're a late addition to the team, so continue to adapt to our defensive strategy. And it has to carry energy. They are ready to work and full of energy. ——Jordan Walker, who Hardy got the team’s Exhibit 10 contract: This is a huge growth process, first game, DNP. In the second game, I played a little longer. In the third game, I played a little more time. In the fourth game, more minutes were played. In the fifth game, more minutes were played. I took a chance and I think everyone saw that. I'm grateful for the Mavericks' trust in me. For me to be able to come here. I'm very lucky to be able to grow every game I play. With 4 wins and 1 loss, I’m happy to get this opportunity. I want to thank Mark Cuban, Nico Harrison and J. Kidd. This was my first real opportunity. I want to have another one next year and then I'll be ready to go. ——Dudley O web link",,,,,0,5,8,7/17/23 16:44,mavschina super talk,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfzzt3akk2j219j0u0wlh.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfzzt0a67aj20u011iwk2.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/ 87dd6bf7gy1hfzzt5jqj2j20u011itey.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfzzt1adtuj20wh0u0wk8.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfzzsyxgltj20u0 11iwjt.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg. cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfzzt2w1huj20u011i43i.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfzzszyjuaj212s0u0q9d.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfzzsytwffj2 0u011idm9.jpg', 'https:// wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfzzt44ovpj20u011iq8o.jpg']",,

Not long ago, well-known sports reporter Jake Fischer revealed in a podcast that the Suns are trying to acquire a point guard through trade negotiations to improve Cam Payne's strength at this position. ""It looks like Phoenix is trying to trade Cam Payne, they want to find someone better than him,"" Jake Fischer said on the show. The Suns recently acquired three future second-round picks, and they could potentially package Payne's $6.5 million salary in a trade. Indiana Pacers shooting guard TJ McConnell has been rumored to be one of the players the Suns are keeping an eye on. Right now, Payne and combo guard Sabine Lee are the only point guards on the Suns -- though there's a feeling the position could be handled by Beal, Devin Booker or even Eric Gordon. Fisher also suggested the Knicks might be able to get involved given their desire to move on from guard Evan Fournier. Fisher quoted sources as saying: ""Rival front offices continue to indicate that New York remains involved in the trade channel for veteran shooter Evan Fournier and that the Knicks are willing to do so as part of a multi-team framework. 28 The 31-year-old Payne averaged 10.4 points and 4.5 assists in 48 games, shooting 42% from the field and 37% from three-point range.

At that time, Lou Williams was still the father of Los Angeles. Almost all buzzer-beating shots would be given to Lou Williams for singles. The best sixth man, he and Ha shared a lot of scoring pressure. I especially remember his difficult drift. Three-pointers can always beat the opponent at critical moments. Then there’s Shamet. This white guy who likes to wear suits always looks out of place when he walks into the tunnel. At that time, he was a first-level shooter in the league. He sprained his foot in that defensive round and limped by. That three-pointer in the half stood out to me. And Beverley, my dog brother, has lost count of his highlight moments, blocking James' buzzer-beating shot, those four consecutive rebounds from the Giants, and crazy output of Paul for Rondo, who is new to the team. ...A true fighter, biting every opponent, no matter who he was, he was the soul of the Clippers at that time.

While maintaining the OG design, the shoe as a whole is injected with oxidized distressed details, giving it the same visual effect as the recently re-engraved AJ1 ""Chicago"". 🔻The color scheme of the original white cement is restored as a whole, retaining the delicate texture of lychee leather and matching the classic crackle design on the toe, which is full of retro temperament. In terms of details, the classic NikeSwoosh and old heel design highlight the classic OG elements. A white distressed midsole paired with a gray outsole completes the design of the entire pair of shoes. 🔻Although it has been reported on the Internet that the workmanship of the shoes is poor, it does not affect everyone's love for it. In one sentence, ""If you go out, you must go in!"" aj[topic]##nike[topic]##aj3[topic]##The most versatile shoes[topic]##Must-have money[topic]##Stick to love[topic]##Unboxing of sneakers[topic]# #WHAT TO WEAR TODAY [TOPIC] # @NIKE # I want traffic [TOPIC] # It’s a pity that the shoe cabinet does not have this pair of shoes #aj6rouge red # Super awesome (I only have one number correct, don’t be deceived) ""Why Can’t you miss the black and red six this time?” How classic is the re-engraved Air Jordan 6 “Infrared” this time? I think as a die-hard Michael Jordan fan, it is impossible not to know that this pair of sneakers was produced by Michael Jordan in the 1990-1991 season. Defeating the shoes worn by Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers, he won his first NBA championship and started the Bulls' first three-peat dynasty. So, with the addition of championship attributes, are these sneakers dazzling? We speak for ourselves. The super classic mid-air layup came from that year's NBA Finals. Although this pair of Air Jordan 6 ""Infrared"" has been re-released in 2010 and 2014, it may sound slightly inferior to the re-release this year. Although the black and red Air Jordan 6 reissued in 2014 was spurned by shoe fans because of the ""pink"" color scheme, it was still sold out quickly after its release and soared to a price of 3,000+ on the secondary market. However, in the past two re-engravings, the classic ""Nike Air"" words were not displayed on the heel position of the shoes, so this is the perfect return version after 19 years of re-engraving in 2000. And you ask me what NikeAir represents? If you think back to how popular the AJ4 white cement heeled by Nike Air was in early 2016, you will understand. Counting this release in 2019, this pair of classic shoes has been released a total of 6 times. Recently, NikeSNKRS also released a comparison between the old and new, allowing us to understand the evolution of the black and red Air Jordan 6 in detail. Let’s take a look at what details have changed in this latest pair of re-engraved sneakers. If you look carefully, you can see that the 2019 model not only brings back the Nike Air heel, but is also closer to the original OG in terms of details. In addition, the breathable holes on the shoe body also continue the 3M reflective details of the 2014 re-engraved model, which brings a good trend element to the entire pair of shoes on the basis of being very low-key overall. Furthermore, combined with the extraordinary texture brought by its own nubuck leather shoe body, the appropriate benefits of infrared red details, and the attributes of being easy to match in terms of wearing, and having a super high degree of reproduction of the OG model, it is already a perfect shoe based on its own conditions. Quite excellent. Not only that, this time Air Jordan 6 Black Infrared also launched children's shoe sizes, allowing your children to wear these Jordan championship boots. It is worth mentioning that this black and red AJ6 is also very conscientious in terms of sales volume. It can be said to be comparable to the ""AJ11 Concord"" to a certain extent. All friends who like AirJordan6 ""Infrared"" can purchase it at the lowest original price! Full of sincerity! Finally, what surprises can there be about the black and red AJ6 that has been reproduced several times? I think that by restoring the OG style to the greatest extent, shoe fans can feel the wonderful game in 1991 and the excitement of Michael Jordan winning the first NBA championship. This alone is satisfying enough. As for this priceless sentiment and belief, is it worth recharging? I believe there is no need to think too much.",,,NIKE,"louisvuitton,lvtrainer,Today’s outfit,louisvuitton,LVtrainer,Off White x LV x Air Force 1,Lv denim blue,lv trainer,lv shoes[topic],Trainer[topic],the most versatile shoes[topic],lv Moon bag, lv baguette bag, LV [topic], LV moon bag [topic], lvloop [topic], lv [topic], Lv [topic], shoes [topic], art gallery [topic], luxury goods [topic] ], luxury shoes [topic], new Lvtrainer [topic], new LV [topic], new lv [topic], new Lv [topic], trainer [topic], fashion [topic], trendy shoes [topic], advanced [topic], color matching [topic], Morandi [topic], LV shoes [topic], LV shoes [topic], mlb daddy shoes, mlb, these can’t beat you [topic], daily life of shoe control [topic] ], aj [topic], nike [topic], aj3 [topic], must deposit [topic], persist in love [topic], sneaker unboxing [topic], what to wear today [topic], I want traffic [topic] ],aj6 carmine",0,0,0,8/3/23 0:28,iPhone client,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/008jCXGtgy1hgiv64kjssj311z0r44b8.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/008jCXGtgy1hgiv63k5hjj31300rv49j.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/ large/ 008jCXGtgy1hgiv66gpldj30qc1ycqm3.jpg']",,
4.93E+15,NcM267pP5,2541959385,Ah Shun talks about the ballSean,"Is it surprising that the Chinese university student team couldn't beat Taiwan and fought Mongolia until the end? It’s because you don’t understand Chinese campus basketball or you don’t understand Chinese campus basketball. Hasn’t Chinese college basketball and campus basketball always been at this level? In 2005 and 2007, they played for the Super League championship team. Because there were many players from the youth training in the Super League at that time, their strength was better than that of pure student players in CUBA, so the results looked good. After that, the number of registered players in the Super League decreased, so it was normal for the record to lag. In the Guangzhou and Naples Universiades, the Chinese team played as CUBA champions and saw all the results. The level of the Chinese basketball professional league is not good. Campus basketball can only and will always be a piece of shit due to the education system. The few that do well in the world are the national team training and youth training. The Chinese men's basketball team has been able to reach the top eight in the world many times in the past, and the women's basketball team has been ranked second in the world. This is also because of the strict echelon training of the national team at all levels, which transports players up layer by layer. As a result, now, a bunch of idiots are preaching that the league should prosper and campus basketball should be done well, completely ignoring the actual national conditions and talking nonsense. PS: I saw the picture online before, but since someone said it was infringing, I deleted it. PPS: There are only two practical ways to find successful experiences from the golden generation of men’s basketball teams and this group of women’s basketball teams. The first is to find talents, and the second is to focus on intensive training. During the winter training in Liuzhou, Wang Zhizhi was trained until he urinated blood. Many of the women's basketball players in this group joined the national-level teams at a very young age, and Xu Limin started practicing hard from the most basic basic skills since childhood. Therefore, the basic skills of this group of women's basketball teams are better than those of the previous group. Like Li Meng never misses any free throws at critical moments. This is all a result of practice. Battle previously said that the national team practices 6 days a week, 8-10 hours a day, and the intensity is extremely high, so most of them have excellent abilities, and most of them are very healthy and free of injuries during their careers. Youth team players practice 6 hours a day. How long do student players practice a day now, and is the training intensity high? If the training intensity is not enough, how can we talk about the level of competition? Basketball training is something where practice makes perfect, and nothing can replace the basic skills of youth training. Just like Wang Zhizhi said when he entered the Chinese Basketball Hall of Fame that I only invest my sweat, Battelle said that basketball is a hard-working sport. Hard work is originally a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation, but now the people have been brainwashed. PPPS: If Chinese basketball wants to rise, you have to look for experience from collective success cases. The golden generation, and now the women's basketball team is the most obvious example, does not rely on a single person to achieve success but relies on collective strength. Instead of looking for answers in the way of failure, such as Chinese campus basketball. After Yao Ming entered his mature stage, there were very few people in the national team who had experienced that kind of devilish training. This is why Yao Ming said in the 2004 Olympics that his teammates and he were not in the same intensity rhythm. Because the level of the CBA league is very low (restrictions on foreign aid), and Yao Ming's league level in the NBA is very high, it would be strange to have a consistent rhythm after playing for a long time. Player Yao Ming, among other things, has never doubted his spirit of training himself to death. Players of his generation and younger than Yao Ming no longer have that kind of hard training experience. # Universiade Men’s Basketball China vs Mongolia # # Universiade Chinese Men’s Basketball Team defeated Mongolia # # Universiade Chinese Men’s Basketball Team won the first time #",,,,"Universiade Men's Basketball Team China vs Mongolia, Universiade Men's Basketball Team China defeated Mongolia, Universiade Men's Basketball Team China won its first victory",6,80,86,8/3/23 0:22,Weibo web version,,,

Inter Milan is unwilling to believe this star with such a bad character. #NBATucaoConference#",,,,NBA Tucao Conference,0,0,1,8/3/23 0:12,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/6302a080gy1hexjh1zxrcj20go0b4tb9.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/6302a080gy1hexjh50wroj20j60cswl7.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/ 6302a080gy1hexjh58txkj20j60aswi6.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/6302a080gy1hexjh5ea94j20j60asjvi.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/6302a080gy1hexjh5jf4xj 20j60asgnu.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg. cn/large/6302a080gy1hexjh5ocypj20j60csq3z.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/6302a080gy1hexjh5uiorj20j60bzdk6.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/6302a080gy1hexjh 61j4lj20j60csjti.jpg', 'https:// wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/6302a080gy1hexjh66vtqj20j60j6gn9.jpg']",,
4.92E+15,Nab5BDteW,7762399751,SEPIAS-Daily Ball Blind Essence,"Let’s talk about some of the rumored targets of the Lone Ranger. Let me talk about the conclusion first. If possible, I like Oubre the best. Bojan: Bojan is definitely a player at a higher level than Hardaway. On the offensive end, Hardaway is already a good shooter, and Bojan's shooting will be more accurate and stable in a larger span of years. In addition, Bo Yang's strength and size are also advantages. No matter whether he is mismatched on the offensive end and plays small, or on the defensive end, he will be stronger. For any team, Bojan would be a big step up on the offensive end. But upgrading the team's lineup will inevitably consume limited resources. The Mavericks' assist defense ability at the fifth position is weak, and they have a defensive black hole like Doncic on the outside. They invest a few reinforcement resources into a team that has strengths, but due to its weaknesses in lateral movement and assist defense, it still can't be considered a frontal defense. For Bo Yang, the marginal improvement on the offensive end has dropped to a very low level, and the defensive end still cannot get rid of the colander state. I am afraid that it will go back to the old path of attacking the strong and defending the weak last season. I don't think Bojan is the type of player the Mavericks need. Derrick Jones Jr.: Without shooting, it is basically a death sentence for NBA outside players-unless you are particularly strong in some other aspects. Jones happens to have a combination of size and athletic ability. However, his shooting has always been low-yield and inefficient, and he has no other skills that are strong enough to make up for his shooting shortcomings. After all, it is still difficult to use. On the defensive end, he is also better at single defense than help defense. He is positioned as a single defense arrow, a bit like Van Der Biao. He cannot be the second help defender that Dallas needs. So is Prosper actually able to do his job? Oubre: Oubre is an offensive master, similar to Kuzma in terms of offensive type. He can do everything but is not good at anything. In addition, his shooting is not good enough, so his positioning is awkward. Oubre's shooting efficiency is lower than expected all year round, and in big years it is only close to the expected value. But fortunately, he dares to shoot, his output has always been very good, and he never refuses to shoot. Oubre's defense is not a hindrance, his frame protection level may be similar to or even slightly better than Gerwei's, and his steal statistics are also good. The single defense relies on athletic ability to support a basic base. It can match up with some large strikers, and the matchup flexibility and difficulty are not low. In my opinion, Oubre has the best overall adaptability and cost-effectiveness among the players available in the free market at this time. You have to ask me if I support it, I do.",,,,,4,20,50,7/16/23 22:38,Weibo web version,,,

This news has been confirmed by the Bucks Notified Warriors management, but has yet to receive a response. According to the trade plan, the Bucks will give Khris Middleton, Julius Junior, Brook Lopez, two first-round picks and two second-round picks. This is a huge deal aimed at improving the Bucks' strength and creating a more comprehensive lineup for the team. The Bucks management stated that if the Warriors are not satisfied with the deal chips, they are willing to negotiate, and said that in addition to the team's core Antetokounmpo, other players can also participate in the transaction. This shows that the Bucks hope to use this deal to consolidate their competitive position in the Eastern Conference and further enhance the team's championship competitiveness. This news caused quite a stir in NBA circles. Stephen Curry is one of the most influential three-point shooters in NBA history. His arrival will bring a lot of threats to the Bucks' offensive end. Andrew Wiggins is an excellent shooting guard, and his excellent shooting and defensive abilities will further enhance the Bucks' overall strength. Trump is a young player with great potential, and his arrival will inject new energy and future development space into the Bucks. However, there are some unknowns and challenges with this agreement. First, it remains to be seen whether Warriors management is satisfied with the trade chips provided by the Bucks. The Warriors must evaluate the long-term benefits of this deal before deciding whether to accept it. Secondly, the Bucks may need to further adjust their trading chips to suit the needs of the Warriors, which will require more in-depth negotiations between the two parties. Regardless, the possibility of this trade has sparked buzz and predictions from fans. If the deal goes through, the Bucks will build a strong team and become one of the favorites to win the Eastern Conference championship, competing fiercely with opponents such as the Nets and Celtics.",,,,"sports, NBA",1,3,1,7/15/23 16:06,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/6cb4d36dly1hf3czr47gcj20hs0br3yy.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/6cb4d36dly1hf3czr7jvgj20nz0c8ta9.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/ 6cb4d36dly1hf3czr4ct3j20h80a70tg.jpg']",,

4.92E+15,N9RSHlIpH,2541959385,Ah Shun talks about the ballSean,"Many people say Zou Yang, let me tell you something. For many players who can’t shoot at all, the so-called practice of shooting through hard training has always been a false proposition, because shooting itself is inherently talented, and the flexibility of the players’ fingers and wrists And the ability to control force is largely difficult to improve after entering the profession. If you could practice shooting well through hard work, then extremely hard-working players like Antetokounmpo and Westbrook would have mastered shooting long ago, and there wouldn't be a bunch of NBA players who couldn't practice shooting throughout their careers. Players can improve their shooting level from 50 points to 70 points through hard training, but they can never improve from 50 points to 90 points. Zou Yang's shooting ability for CBA is now 20 points. It is no less difficult for him to improve to 60 points than it is for a mid-level pitcher (Zhao Rui level) to progress to a top pitcher (Zhu Fangyu level). For example, Kidd was a player with mediocre shooting ability in his early years. Later in his career, he became a very high-quality three-point shooter. However, it is absolutely impossible for Kidd to use hard training to make his shooting ability reach the same level as Nash. . Previously, Cheshen @太武车神 said that I agree with Alphabet’s point of view on shooting. Alphabet believes that if you train enough, your shooting will improve, but the reality is often the opposite. In the history of the NBA, there has never been a mediocre shooter who entered the league who has worked hard to become the most elite shooter. If you look at NBA data, you will find that those with the highest three-point shooting percentages every year are generally those who are stable. In the past few years, Zou Yang's three-point shooting rate in college-level games has only been 20%. There is no doubt that CBA is more intense than CUBA. It is up to you to imagine what level Zou Yang can shoot. In the past three seasons, the CBA's overall three-point shooting percentage in the regular season was 33.9%, 35.3% and 35.6%. Zou Yang is now 23 years old. How long will it take for him to improve his shooting ability to the CBA average level? In addition, I don't think Zou Yang can perform as well as Li Weihao in the CBA.

Samuels was a member of Villanueva's championship team (as a freshman). (Year), he played in college for 5 years and was on the second team of the Pacers last year; Meyer is also a fifth-year graduate and a main member of Baylor University's championship team. Hinton has been in the league for three years and entered the league in 20 years, bouncing in and out between the Development League and the NBA. Fletcher Magee is also a senior. He graduated in 2018 and has been playing in European leagues for the past three years. He is a shooter with a great 3-point shooting percentage. He is 26 years old this year and is the oldest player on the team. So I say, it’s not too much to say that these players are already relatively mature professional players. A bunch of big brothers accompany the White Devils to play games together. The Rockets average 13.5 turnovers per game, fifth fewest in the league. Why? Being older may have an absolute advantage in this regard. Think about what the Rockets' main lineup was during last summer league? TOEFL, Ethan, Smith, Taitai, Nix, all the little brats plus Xinguadanzi... So there is no need to brag about the coach because of the good results this year~, the coaching staff is also new, and the players are also temporarily formed. , the Rockets know exactly what this team needs. I have never believed in the conclusion that young people are unreliable. The management does not know this. The practice of appointing young people in the past three years has been done deliberately to maximize the probability of obtaining high-ranking talents. Just showing off in disguise.

4.92E+15,N9E4y0dgt,1787124455,boiler cat three,"""The man with the big beard who crossed the Temple of Wealth three times burned down Xinyi Square"" The NBA free agent market in July 2023 is as lively as in previous years, but the excitement belongs to others, and James Harden has nothing. Harden did not enter the free agent market, did not receive a big contract, neither left Philadelphia nor completely stayed. In the end, not many people cared about any of this. Every crotch dribbling clip of Bunyama in the summer league was far more eye-catching than Harden's movements. Of course, apart from dancing between Booker and Jenner in white, Harden actually doesn't have much action. Thirteen days have passed since Harden chose to exercise his player option. He is now only a 33-year-old player with a one-year contract worth $35.5 million. When you look at the silence and almost indifference towards the 33-year-old player on the basketball court, in the business world and in the public opinion arena, you can only lament that everything in the past is the past. What about the 10th All-Star, what about three consecutive scoring champions, what about MVP, what about the 76th Big Game, a humble room with an empty hall, but the bed was full of wats. So what is Harden doing now? It is said that he is negotiating with Philadelphia, hoping to trade himself to a team that is expected to win the championship. Philadelphia may or may not make a trade, but sources say they are still willing to keep Harden. It sounds like the kind of market legend that would be made up by the worst writers in ""Story Club"". It talks about some coincidences related to causal loops. It can be summed up in two short sentences: In 2022, Harden I hope to stay with the Nets and look for trade options. In 2023, Philadelphia hopes to retain Harden and seek trade options. I still remember when Nets general manager Marks said that he was very grateful to Harden for his ""sincerity"". You don't know how many flies he had swallowed in advance to be able to hold back his nausea and express such gratitude. It turns out the nausea doesn't go away, it just shifts, and now it's Harden's turn to experience it. No matter what the final result is, there is only one thing that is certain at this stage: Philadelphia will not choose his favorite next destination for Harden, they will not let Harden walk away in vain, and they will not accept a few second rounds plus a few first rounders. Swap offers, from the outset they announced that they would only do valuable transactions. What if no valuable transactions appear? Ben Simmons knows what Philadelphia will do. And what is a valuable trade in Philadelphia's eyes? For reference, it was previously reported that they asked the Cavaliers for Allen, Mobley and a first-rounder in exchange for Tobias Harris. And what team does Harden think has a chance to win the championship? no one knows. This team may need to have a certain amount of space shooters, maybe it must have a striker with independent offensive capabilities, maybe it must have some long-term stable core members, maybe the regular season record has always been in the top four in the division over the years, and it may seem competitive. Fortunately, there is already a super giant in charge of the basics. It would be best if he is the MVP in his prime. Maybe this team is the Philadelphia before us. A year ago, when Harden chose to cut his salary by 15 million to renew his contract, he said: ""The championship is the most important. And the money will always come back."" From the fact that Harden was so confident at the beginning, he has already figured out where the money will come from. Think about it, wouldn't it be enough to just break out of the contract in the summer of 2023 and then renew a high-paying long-term contract with Philadelphia? But there was no movement in Philadelphia. What Harden faced was endless silence. This silence was similar to saying: If you want a long and big contract, you might as well go to the market to inquire first. Harden tried out, and even earlier there were rumors that he would return to the Rockets. At that time, the Rockets had enough salary space. Although the breakup was not honorable, in any case, Harden grew from the best sixth man to the MVP here, and the most glorious part of his career was created in Houston. The Rockets can be regarded as Harden's true home team, and their logic in choosing to welcome Harden back doesn't seem to have much of a problem. But it is obvious that his old club did not give Harden any promises or hints in advance. Other rebuilding teams with room for reconstruction will not give Harden a five-year contract worth more than 200 million. Harden chose to exercise the player option in the last year. I already knew this very well. Facts have proved that Harden and his team's judgment on the market was generally good. As soon as the free agent market opened, the Rockets issued a maximum salary to VanVleet at the speed of light, and then signed 6 people to directly fill the salary space. Afterwards, a reporter was heart-wrenching: The Rockets did want to sign Harden back, but Udoka refused. The reality is that Harden may never get back the money he lost, because this embarrassing situation will happen again next year. He signed a 1+1 contract last year and was unable to reach an early extension with any team, which means that he will inevitably become a free agent again in the summer of 2024. In the summer of 2024, Harden will be 35 years old and will no longer be eligible to take the civil service examination. In many large factories, he is already on the verge of unemployment. You won’t be able to make back the money this year, let alone next year. Not long ago, I wrote about Lillard's application for a trade. At that time, I mentioned that there is another star in the contemporary era who has a story almost opposite to Lillard's. Many people said that this person is Durant. But Durant is indeed strong enough. No matter where he goes, no matter how injured he is, there are people who are willing to offer him long and big contracts. Durant has not suffered much loss in terms of money. The biggest difference between Lillard and other stars when he applied for a trade was that he had already earned all the money he could earn in his career. Harden, who applied for a trade earlier and left, is exactly the opposite of Lillard. The price of leaving was giving up the money he could have earned in his career. The situation Harden faced with the Rockets in 2020 was almost the same as Lillard faced with the Trail Blazers in 2021: both teams' lineups were devastated. The Rockets sent away Paul, then Capela, and then Westbrook. There were no reinforcements, and then they also sent away Lillard's longest-term partner CJ McCollum; both teams replaced the coach who had been with the star the longest during his peak period, the Rockets opened D'Antoni, and the Trail Blazers Fire Stotts; both teams are going downhill. The Rockets broke into the Western Conference Finals in 2018 and fell to the Western Conference semifinals for two consecutive seasons. The Trail Blazers broke into the Western Conference Finals in 2019 and fell to the first round for two consecutive seasons. . Both teams had become completely one-man-one-city teams at that time, without any competitiveness. Seeing no hope or future, the team looked like it was about to be rebuilt. The final similarity is that both teams are willing to pay their stars the most money possible. The next two stories that basically overlapped began to diverge: In 2021, Lillard was still one year away from meeting the conditions for another two years of maximum salary extension, so he carried the Loyalty Arch and played for another year, and he had to be extended for two years. After receiving the maximum salary, he played another season and applied for a trade. Lillard's story actually ended completely the moment he extended his contract until he was 37 and still got 60 million. Whatever happens later will not hurt the money, and he can focus on chasing his dream of a championship. In 2020, Harden met the conditions for a two-year maximum salary extension, and the Rockets also offered a two-year contract of 103 million. This extension will make Harden the first man with an annual salary of 50 million in the history of the league, but Harden Deng decisively refused and insisted on applying to leave the team to focus on going to the Nets. In fact, after Harden was traded to the Nets, there is still a chance to save everything. Before the start of the 2021-22 season, the Nets offered him a three-year, 161 million contract extension, but Harden refused. The common analysis at the time was that Harden's rejection of this early contract extension was a routine operation for superstars. In the summer of 2022, he could choose to exercise the 47.4 million player option for the last year (2022-23 season) and complete a contract with the team. A four-year, 223 million contract extension will make Harden the first player in history with an annual salary of more than 60 million when he is 36 years old. After Harden refused to renew his contract in 2021, he reassured the people of Brooklyn: ""I am just focusing on ensuring my health and fighting for the championship. I will not leave the team, everyone can rest assured... As for the contract and money, it will come It will always come."" Such a familiar confident argument. But there is always a chance that what is supposed to come will not come. As the 2021-22 season progressed, some indescribable things began to happen. Harden once again did not endure the humiliation like Lillard, and he applied for a trade for the second time. He surrendered to that man. Said to be one of his best friends when he was with the Rockets. But he may not have noticed that what his friend is best at is saving money and avoiding taxes. The story behind was as out of control as a collapsing glacier. Harden jumped out of the contract like crazy, took a salary cut of 15 million, renewed the contract for 1+1, and told everyone that the money would come back. However, if you don’t enter the God of Wealth after three visits, the God of Wealth also has a temper. You can throw coins, but you really can't play with money. In 2 years, Harden missed 103 million in 2 years, rejected 161 million in 3 years, lost 223 million in 4 years, and finally paid 15 million out of his own pocket. In the end, he was making wedding clothes for others, and only moved himself. . Originally, no matter what level Harden is now, he should have been one of the people with the highest annual income, but now he is a player with an annual salary of 35 million, and there are 44 players with an annual salary of more than 30 million next season. This is also the most ridiculous point in Harden's story. You Harden said that he is chasing the championship, so why am I, Lillard, not the same? We are all former All-Stars and current 76ers who are chasing championships. You are still worrying about money, but I am not distracted and I am more pure than you. I am indeed an out-of-shape middle-aged woman who is going through a divorce, but I have joint property that can be divided, and you are just a second-hand mistress who is going through a breakup. Let’s make a judgment, fat friend! At the end of 2020, Antetokounmpo stood silent in front of the designated veteran super-maximum salary. ""American Yang Yi"" Stephen A. Smith urged Antetokounmpo to sign. The Bucks were not grateful for this, because what the old broadcaster said later was enough to make everyone The team management was timid: ""Sign it. Signing a super contract does not mean you have to stay on the team. You can always request a trade to leave the team. Just like some stars, you can get money and compete for the championship."" As for The reason why Harden made those decisions that now seem ridiculous and thigh-slapping may be simpler than we think. Since 2018, Harden has not had an agent, but has been represented by his mother in some matters. It was not until February this year that he hired an agent again. Harden's last max-salary long-term contract was signed in 2017. At that time, his agent was Pelinka, who went to the Lakers to become the general manager. So basically we can conclude that after the last long-term maximum salary contract in 2017, all operations were Harden's own actions. Where does Harden get the confidence to make the most beneficial move for himself and sign the contract that is most beneficial to him? Picture: On the one hand, we guess that Harden may feel that he is a talented and bold person, and wherever he goes, he is guaranteed a maximum salary. Then the NBA's maximum salary contracts have a prescribed model, and there is not much room for bargaining. Then there are Why do you need to pay someone to sign for you? On the other hand, his source of confidence may be: Harden studied at Arizona State University, majoring in business management. So Harden's story finally tells a simple truth to all of you college friends who have just received the admission notice: You must not neglect your studies when you get to college!",,,,,30,74,441,7/13/23 10:35,,,,

From a shooting perspective, Osman, who entered the industry with 37.6% three-pointers, has become more and more of a fixed-point player in recent years.

What is the biggest difficulty you have encountered in the Premier League? ""The intensity is very high. We have been running at full speed without rest, but this way of playing can also make your character tougher. Now I feel stronger and more intense."" You have also played against How do you feel about Guardiola's super striker Haaland? ""We're talking about an absolutely top player, but to be honest, the one who impressed me the most on the court was De Bruyne, who could play incredible football on the court."" Your former teammate Rice is worth 120 million Are you surprised by the move to Arsenal? ""Why are you surprised? This is probably missing... He is very strong, reminiscent of Gerrard, Rice is the strongest midfielder I have ever played with."" You will anger your good friend Fratsi, who Just moved to Inter Milan... ""Davide is not that sensitive, and he has different technical characteristics. I know he will join Inter Milan. He is a mezzala, good at breaking into the penalty area, and his ability to penetrate forward is very good. Inter Milan is good for him. An ideal choice."" Fratsi doesn't want to play abroad. Did you suggest that he stay in Italy? ""He made the right choice to choose Inter Milan. He can play for the top team in Italy. I didn't have such an opportunity because everyone had no money last summer... I am more open-minded than Davide and I am also satisfied with the result. The Premier League is the football NBA. .”Do you miss Italy? ""I will always miss you, but..."" What happened? ""If I return to Serie A, it will not be because I failed in the Premier League. That is not the case. The reason is very simple. My return to Italy means that I have encountered an opportunity that cannot be missed, so this is not a setback in my career. Serie A is still the most One of the best leagues."" This summer window is also very lively. Do you want to play against Fratesi in the Milan Derby, El Clasico, or join Roma? ""I have always followed my heart when making choices, and I will continue to do so in the future. I know what my two favorite colors are, but I am a West Ham United player now. Although there are many rumors, but I feel here. Very good too."" What do you think of Roma and Mourinho? ""For me, Roma is my home, Totti was my idol as a child, and which player in the world wouldn't dream of being coached by Mourinho? I believe Mourinho can inspire me and play under him. It can take me one step further."" Did Lorenzo Pellegrini recruit you as well? ""We will communicate, he is my friend, let's put it this way, we will make some related jokes."" Is missing Italy also related to next year's European Cup? ""No, whether I can be selected for the national team only depends on myself. It has nothing to do with whether I play in Serie A or the Premier League. I believe I can participate in the European Cup."" What do you think of Retegui? Does this worry you or motivate you? ""Competition helps to improve, and since I was a child, I have only focused on myself and not others."" Did Tonali call you before joining Newcastle? ""We talked after the official announcement. I wish him good luck. Sandro is very strong and has all the conditions to gain a foothold in the Premier League."" Sassuolo has produced many talents in recent years. What is the secret of their success? ? ""The competition there is fierce, but there is not much pressure. The club allows the players to express themselves at their best.""

4.92E+15,N9v3BATBU,6748483996,Qiu Mo Austin,"""In the past two days, my discussion with T-MAO teacher @T-Mao was not Tianmiao and I just happened to talk about the Grizzlies. I put together some of my thoughts and posted them on two Weibo posts, which is a summary of the 23rd Grizzlies season."" Continued from the previous article... ·JJJ's offense is still too purely end-point, and he has basically not passed the ball at all in his career. It can be said that he is selfish for a USG, and his ability to handle the ball when encountering a double attack is quite poor. But in fact, no one thinks he is selfish. Maybe his offensive expectations are too low. This season, his near-frame efficiency has increased by 10 points compared to last season, and he can start to eat people in the low post. When Morant is not around, he can play some high-volume games as the team's first scoring point (37 points and 41 points). . During the offseason last year, Parker @leecjcn1998 said that JJJ is just like Lowe who can score some points, and is 10 million more expensive than the latter. From this point of view, he has definitely improved this season. I chatted with JJJ fan and alumnus @mmmmmitn1, and we both expected him to average 21+ per game next season, and his offensive ceiling can be increased even more. The main reason is that there are too many fourth positions in the league with ridiculous sizes. JJJ has basically been playing against short or skinny guys, so he should be criticized for his inability to produce results. JJJ gave me huge confidence in the playoffs. He proved himself in two areas that needed to be proven: 1) He couldn't stay on the court. Then as the team's only inside pillar, he averaged 37 minutes per game in the series. 2) Offense is not good. Then he defeated everyone except AD one-on-one. If these two can be partially realized in the regular season (for example, averaging not 26 minutes but 32 points per game, facing lower defensive intensity), combined with DPOY-level defense, he will basically be a player at the lower limit of the best team level. In the past two years, he played 141 of the 149 regular season games. Considering that there will be no awards for people with excellent attendance next season, it is expected that JJJ will be selected for the best team. ·Kennard is definitely one of the Grizzlies' rotations with the highest strategic value in 24, and he is a natural fit with the Grizzlies. The Grizzlies can completely protect him on the defensive end, and his three-point threat is scarce in the Grizzlies. It is said that Kennard steals well without paying much attention to it, and can occasionally play as a ball carrier. Adams' cover bonus for shooters/chaos opportunities created by the front board will definitely allow him to take his level to a higher level next season. ·The second aunt is a soft-hearted person. When there was a basketball under the basket in the playoffs, she lay down on the ground before facing Hachimura Rui. She subconsciously drew a foul instead of guarding the ball, so she was destined to be impossible to protect the rim. hand. His ability to protect the Grizzlies' frame on the field is not excessive, but he can only say that he shot well from three-point range this year. ·Konchar's rebounding level per unit time is extremely scary, and his finishing level in transition is underestimated (he can often finish with someone on top). However, the fixed-point wing with no ability to hold the ball is useless if he can't score. Later in the season, Kennard was completely pushed out of the rotation. ·Tilman defends the low post too well. All the great interior offensive players you know have been defeated by him. ·Rody is a player who simply cannot become an above-average defender. Lateral movement is a disaster in Summer League. He was beaten by various positions 1 to 5 during the season. In 2023, he can still be held by Westbrook without a pick-and-roll. Not many NBA players pass by and dunk. The main person responsible for the Grizzlies' defense failing to rank first in the league. Not to mention the offense. ·The main problem with Zawei is that his offensive completion is too low, with nothing but static. Last year's Summer League and the preseason saw the Grizzlies thrive, and they were ready to force him into the starting three, giving him a lot of time and authority to hold the ball. As a result, the Summer League was so intense that he almost dropped the ball in halftime without any confrontation. This guy's ability to hold the ball is about this, and he is probably for sale at the moment. #nba#Memphis Grizzlies",,,"T-Mao is not Tianmiao,leecjcn1998,mmmmmitn1",NBA,0,8,24,7/12/23 11:38,Weibo web version,,,
4.92E+15,N9uZUhNez,6748483996,Qiu Mo Austin,"In the past two days, my discussion with T-MAO teacher @T-Mao happened to be about the Grizzlies. I put together some random thoughts and posted them on two Weibo posts, which was a summary of the 23rd Grizzlies season. ·The Grizzlies have the impression that they have a lot of people and are good at rebounding. In fact, they are more of a threat. Although the Grizzlies are the only team in the league with three inside rotations with a score of 211+ (JJJ-Er Auntie-Yadan), the first two are weak in terms of blocking habits and actual rebounding ability. The Grizzlies' level of protecting backcourt rebounds has always been the same. Even for a team like the 22 Grizzlies, which almost dominates the hustle statistics, the backboard rate is only slightly better than the league average. This season, there are more white men and two players left. The situation with important blacks is very poor (League 21). There are two reasons why the Grizzlies can't get backcourt rebounds. 1) The Grizzlies starting lineup is top-heavy and the first, second and third positions are all on the short side, especially the wingspan of the second and third positions is very impressive. When the Grizzlies shoot a lot of non-corner three-pointers (second in the league in frequency), they often fail to grab long rebounds that are flying everywhere. Playing against the Warriors is a very obvious example. Basically, they lose rebounds every game in the regular season and playoffs. 2) JJJ’s rebounding habits are too poor. JJJ has always had very few rebounds. His rebound rate before and after his career is basically at the same level as the backside of the same position (this season’s front rebound rate is over 29%, and his back rebound rate is over 38%). When watching the game, there are many people who only watch the ball and don’t block people. The play of picking off a board on the head has a very bad scene. There are different opinions on the reasons why JJJ is not good at rebounding. Personally, I prefer defensive habits (sweeping around and away from the basket) and team environment (since joining the industry, he has been paired with a traditional center with strong rebounds, so he does not need to grab it). The fact that the Grizzlies have so many front rebounds is a blessing in disguise. Before Adams fell, the Grizzlies ranked 3rd in front rebound rate and 25th after he fell. This is enough to show how mediocre this team's rebounding ability is after taking away Adams. ·The Grizzlies ranked 10th in the league in three-point frequency and 16th in field goal percentage during the same period after Kennard came. They are considered medium-to-high productivity and medium-efficiency. They should continue to get better next season. ·Many Grizzlies fans feel like Bane has regressed this season, which I can't understand at all. Last season, Bane was a wing who could score a little more points than ordinary shooters. He was still a shooter in essence. He couldn't make a move when faced with high-quality off-ball pursuits and pick-and-roll defenses (for example, he averaged 9 shots and 9 points in the first four games against the Warriors). , it seems that the shooting rate is extremely high, but there is no offensive presence on the court. Bain's biggest improvement this season is to get rid of the pure shooter position and be able to produce three-pointers and nothing. From a playoff perspective, being able to score points stably without making three-pointers is much more useful than actually failing to make 45% of three-pointers on paper. Bain's pure shooting this year has dropped a lot compared to last year, and he has a lot more open shots than last season. However, while his efficiency is still excellent (61ts), he has become a player with stronger pure strength. It also showed in the playoffs. ·23 On the issue of Dillon overstepping his authority, I think it is much better than last year. 22 Dillon has 21 shots in 36 minutes in the regular season and 18 shots in the playoffs. He has the right to score at a scoring level. He can make three-pointers in various transitions and beat the Warriors inexplicably. This season he transitioned to fixed-point 3D and shot a lot of catchers. 37% of wide-open three-pointers and 36% of catch-and-shoot three-pointers combined with production are actually not bad. There are traces of his transition to pure engineer 3D next season. #nba#Memphis Grizzlies",,,T-Mao is not Tianmao,NBA,1,14,17,7/12/23 11:29,Weibo web version,,,
4.92E+15,N9uwtmrpe,1808638663,Citizen Uitler,"Mayer observed again and saw that he had just played a game. He played five years in college, the first four at Baylor, and his final year at Illinois. To say he is a shooter is actually not accurate. After increasing his production in the two years after college, he became a mid-level and inefficient shooter, with a three-point shooting percentage of only 32-33. The characteristic of this person is that he has good combination of man and ball, especially for his height, he has strong movement control ability, so he has many ball-holding scenes, and USG has always been good. He is also very tough on the defensive end. His college career steal rate is close to 3, and his rebounding ability is also good. In college, he was considered an all-around offensive and defensive player, with great versatility. But his talent was so poor that he eventually withdrew from the contest two years in a row. I checked his agent, and he is the same agent as Ryan Anderson. Apart from that, he only represents TV sets. He is unknown. He may have been recommended to the Rockets because of Anderson's relationship. Anderson has always had a good relationship with the Rockets, and he briefly coached young people on the team in shooting last season. However, I feel that as a 24-year-old player, he needs the opportunity to enter the league quickly instead of wasting time in the Development League. The Rockets are overcrowded in the position he plays, making it difficult to become a regular. Although I like Mayer, I predict that eventually, in training camp, he may be signed by another team. Of course it would be best to stay.

4.92E+15,N9oIV7pVI,1937280734,Hupu Sports,"Industry insiders have mixed reactions to the signings of Rui Hachimura and Russell. Recently, ""Los Angeles Times"" Lakers team reporter Dan Woike interviewed many NBA industry insiders during the summer league, including team executives, coaches, former players, NBA and college scouts, etc., to ask them what they think of the Lakers. There have been some mixed reviews surrounding the signings of Rui Hachimura and D’Angelo Russell, which is to be expected given their resumes in the league. For Hachimura, when the Lakers are paying him an average of $17 million per year over the next three seasons, some executives are wondering who the Lakers are bidding on in free agency. They thought the Lakers might be able to sign a better contract. However, supporters of the decision point to two key factors. First, Hachimura answered the big question about him - how he performs in the spotlight. Hachimura had a great playoff run and became one of the team's most reliable shooters. Second, he's shown his usual tenacity and fighting spirit -- his willingness to guard center Nikola Jokic, for example -- which has some in the NBA thinking the Lakers may have unlocked something in him. As for Russell, there are still big questions about his reliability on the defensive end for a team with championship aspirations, and the last memory of his struggles in the Western Conference Finals is still fresh in his mind. However, his talent is there and the Lakers could find a trade partner if necessary, as his two-year contract has a player option on the final year.

4.92E+15,N9euN0844,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"What if Curry played in the 1990s? This issue was discussed last year. I will add a few words to sort out my thoughts. I think: Superstars will be superstars in any era, and they will make corresponding adjustments according to the era at that time. The same goes for Curry. The difference just depends on what they can achieve under different coaches - if they can meet Nelson or Riley, then maybe the times will change ahead of schedule. Stephen Curry was an All-Star guard who averaged 24 points and 9 assists per game under Mark Jackson; Kerr took over and with a good lineup, Curry immediately took off and became a historical offensive player, winning consecutive MVPs, historical statistics, and championships. . For example, Nash was an All-Star under Nelson in Dallas and was on the third team of the league; when he arrived with D'Antoni in the Suns, he was well matched and became a two-time regular season MVP, the assist leader, and a historical offensive player. ——As an aside, old Mark himself is a legendary point guard with over 10,000 assists, so he wants Curry to score + assists with the ball; Cole himself is a legendary shooter, and is proficient in triangle offense and space routines, so he uses Dream Chaser. Unleashing Curry's unparalleled off-ball threat in history. A player is viewed differently by different coaches. When Curry first became famous, many people looked for the old template for him: similar players who can move and pass and have magical baskets: Mark Price, Abdul Rauf and the like. Price is a short, white version of Curry. Three-point shooting was not popular in the NBA during the 1992-93 season, and the three-point shooting ratio in the NBA was only 10%. It does not prevent Price from leading the Cavaliers to third place in the Eastern Conference. He averages 18 points and 8 assists per game, and his shooting percentage is 48%+42%+95%. He is tied with Jordan for the first-team guard in the league. The next year he also went to the Dream Team II. Anyone who has watched Price play knows that he is a weakened version of Curry - in fact, he may be more like a shorter version of Nash than Curry - but he can also be in the league. As an aside, that Cavaliers team is very friendly to shooters, and their No. 4 is Steve Kerr. Cole later went to the Bulls and wore No. 25 - the Cavaliers' No. 25, which was Price. For Curry's ball-handling style, you can refer to the Cavaliers' version of Price; for his off-ball configuration, you can refer to the Pacers' version of Reggie Miller. Miller's regular season statistics are not very impressive, but in the six Eastern Conference finals in his career, three of them were lost 3-4, otherwise he would have entered the finals - those three times were the losses to Ewing's Knicks, the Sharks' Magic and Jordan's final Bull of the year. Larry Brown and Larry Bird, if they build the team correctly around Miller, Miller can enter the NBA Finals with Smits, Mark Jackson Sr., and the two Davis configurations. . Curry's ability to hold the ball is higher than Price's, and his ability to move without the ball is higher than Miller's. He has the best of both worlds. Just give him a long man like the Pacers/Cavaliers to support the frontcourt, give him a smart long man like Daugherty/Smits, and give him a tough forward like Nance/Davis. The most suitable configuration for Curry is the Charlotte Hornets in the 1996-97 season: the Hornets at that time, defense + point forward 201 cm tall Mason (averaging 16 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists per game), supporting center bearded Divac (average 13 points, 9 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 blocks), the league's top shooter All-Star Game MVP Glenn Rice (averaging 27 points per game), plus Curry's own father Del Curry, easily 54 wins. Mason is the dream chaser of the 1990s. Divac can be regarded as the Bogut of the 1990s. If Curry comes in to replace Rice - his off-ball, ball-handling and long-range shots are all better than Rice - or replace his biological father, wouldn't this lineup be able to play? I should have finished talking about this topic, but I still want to talk a few more words: In fact, the gap between top players in different eras may not be as big as everyone thinks. It’s not like no one has experienced the Curry era and the Jordan era. Ray Allen entered the industry in 1996. In Jordan's last year with the Bulls, Ray Allen became the starter in his second year, averaging 20+5+4, 43%+36%+88% per game, and PER16. At the age of 35, Ray Allen averaged 36 minutes and 17 points per game. 3 rebounds and 3 assists, 49%+44%+88%, PER16. Ray Allen is known as a consistent player. In 1998 and 2010, from the Jordan era to the Curry era, the gap seemed not big? Duncan had 19+11+3+2 every 36 minutes in the 1997-98 season, shooting 55% from the field. By the 2009-10 season, Duncan had 21+11+4 per 36 minutes, shooting 51% from the field. Duncan is notoriously immovable. From the last year of the Jordan era to the Curry era, the gap seems not that big? In the 2009-10 season, Curry averaged 19+4+6 per game in his rookie year, and his three-point shooting percentage was 48%+44%+93%. There seems to be no sign that he couldn't play in the 1990s... Of course, I know many people will say, ""Curry's three-pointers couldn't be used in the 1990s."" It is true that shooting three-pointers was not popular in the 1990s. When he first started shooting a lot, he was probably scolded by the coach. But let’s put it another way: not all coaches in old age are blind, especially in the early 1990s, when the three-point shot was popular. If you really shoot accurately, a coach will give you the green light. Going back to the Jordan era, let’s talk about a typical case. Dana Barros, a small guard, played a total of 27 starts in the first four years of his career. In the 1993-94 season, he had 13 points and 5 assists per game, with a three-point rate of 38%: because he had the ability to force three-pointers. In the next year's 1994-95 season, the Philadelphia 76ers gave Dana Burrows unlimited firing rights. Burrows averaged 5.2 shots per game and made 2.4 three-pointers, shooting 46% from the field. Entered the All-Star - no one probably knows this All-Star now, why? Just by holding the ball in his hand, he made a three-pointer. The next year he went to Boston to come on the bench and still had unlimited firepower, making 4.6 and 1.9 shots per game. In fact, in the 1996-97 season, Tim Hardaway shot 34% and shot 8 three-pointers per game. ——Shooting three-pointers was really frowned upon in that era, but if you were really accurate and could shoot off the dribble, the whole team would give you the green light. ——If you shoot accurately, Jordan will pass the ball to you at critical moments... So, with the accuracy and range of Burrows and Tim Hardaway, the team can fire unlimitedly for them. right. Stephen Curry has arrived in the 1990s. With his unparalleled off-ball threat and ability to shoot three-pointers off the dribble, the coach still can’t let him take enough shots? The biggest difference between the 1990s and this generation is actually the width of the space under the basket, which affects breakthroughs more. In those days, double-team pressure was not yet popular, and few teams were good at it. The so-called tough perimeter pressure and physical contact were more targeted at breakthrough players. His peripheral shooting skills are unparalleled in ancient and modern times, as well as his free attack ability that can be used anytime and anywhere. They are popular in any era. Finally, let’s talk about a inheritance. Tim Hardaway entered the NBA in 1989. In his first season, he averaged 13 shots per game and 1.1 three-pointers. Two years later, he shot 5 three-pointers per game and averaged 23 points and 10 assists per game; who allowed him to shoot? Mad scientist Coach Nelson. By the 1997-97 season, the Beetles were averaging 7.3 three-pointers per game with the Miami Heat. Who allowed him to vote? Pat Riley. The pioneering consciousness of Nelson and Riley is so obvious. Nash averaged less than one three-pointer per game in his rookie year and averaged four three-pointers per game in the 2001-02 season. Who allowed him to vote? Old Nelson. Later, Nash went to the Suns and became the MVP. In 2009, when Cole was in the Suns, he wanted to select Curry and wanted Curry to accept Shi's mantle, but the Warriors got there first. Warriors general manager Larry Riley. What did he do before? Answer: Nelson's assistant coach. Nelson and his assistants, as well as the Warriors, Tim Hardaway, Dallas, Phoenix, Nash, many bold experiments, many releases of authority, many crazy ideas - finally merged into Curry.

4.92E+15,N9dBHrG0S,5818848380,Love some mandarin duck music,"#体育##NBA# The Warriors and Lakers have been eliminated. If they want to continue to be a championship team next season, both teams need some changes. On May 31st, Beijing time, the US media supported Hu Yong in a 3-for-1 deal, each getting what they needed and achieving a win-win situation. The specific trade plan is for the Lakers to send Rui Hachimura, Reeves and a 2029 first-round pick to get Thompson from the Warriors. The Lakers build a new trident. The reason why the US media believes that the Lakers will be willing to consider this plan is that Thompson's technical characteristics are very suitable for the Lakers and is expected to become James' new perfect match. He is one of the best outside shooters in NBA history. With his restraint on the court, James and Big Eyebrow can get better scoring opportunities. In the regular season this season, Thompson averaged 21.9 points per game, shot 41.2% from three-point range, and made 87.9% from free throws. He made a total of 301 three-pointers in the regular season, ranking first in the league. Although his form declined in the playoffs, averaging 18.5 points per game and shooting 36.8% from three-point range, one thing that is certain is that he will always be an elite shooter before Thompson retires. Although his defensive ability after returning from a serious injury has has declined, but can still defend players in multiple positions. Of course, Thompson still has enough experience in the playoffs and finals. He helped the Warriors win four championships and was selected to the All-Star five times during this period. The Warriors' replacement of fresh blood in the library is not for sale, but Thompson is not. If there is a good trading plan, I believe the Warriors will be willing to consider it. The Warriors don't want to give Thompson a maximum salary. If he can be exchanged for Rui Hachimura, Reeves and a first-rounder, the Warriors will at least evaluate the offer. Reeves and Hachimura are both young and promising players. Reeves averaged 13 points, 3 rebounds and 3.4 assists in the regular season, and his playoff data increased to 16.9 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.6 assists. Hachimura averaged 11.2 points per game in the regular season and 12.2 points in the playoffs. COSCO's shooting performance was stable. As for the first-round pick in 2029, it is expected to be very valuable. By then James has retired, and the Lakers' first-round pick may become a high draft pick. The Warriors and Lakers are both popular teams, and there will definitely be a lot of trade rumors during the offseason. Executives on both sides need to evaluate the possibilities to see if there is an opportunity to help strengthen their respective cores.",,,,"sports, NBA",0,0,0,7/10/23 15:13,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hehqdddu3mj20m80et76u.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hehqddbxk5j20qo0g0q55.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/ d1b82c50ly1hehqdd9ii7j20qn0fx3zh.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hehqddfgb8j20qo0hyn1f.jpg']",,

4.92E+15,N99PAzHMs,6212444187,Basketball burning zone,"The Warriors signed Dario Saric to add interior space and shooting threat. Dario Saric joined the Warriors on a one-year contract. The Warriors hope that he can play the role of Otto Porter in the 21-22 season and contribute to the team. Increase inside space and cooperate with inside players such as Draymond Green, Kevin Looney, Kuminga, etc. to stretch the opponent's defense. However, fans believe that Saric has a greater chance of becoming Bjelica's successor. Saric is an excellent inside player, and his combination with players such as Green, Looney and Kuminga will provide the Warriors with a wider offensive space. Although Saric did not average much playing time per game last season, he performed well in three-point shooting. Past regular season data shows that Saric's overall three-point shooting rate of 39.1% exceeded 82% of players, his catch-and-shoot three-point shooting rate was 40.4%, his corner three-point shooting rate was 44.8%, and his non-corner three-point shooting rate was 37.2%. This makes the Warriors believe that he can become an important player who can shoot threats from the outside. Such a shooter can effectively open up the space and bring more passing options to Curry and Paul. Saric's joining also received support from Paul. The two of them worked well together during the Suns' period and can also play an important role in the Warriors' second unit. As for Paul, Curry once again expressed his expectation to become teammates with Paul on the ESPN podcast. He praised Paul's talent and his attitude of working hard to become a core defender in the game, and emphasized that they hope to return to a championship level. Bringing in a player like Paul who knows how to run an offense will bring unique characteristics to the Warriors' offense. In terms of finances, the Warriors currently have 13 guaranteed contracts and 3 two-way contract spots remaining, and the team's total salary has reached a cumulative US$207 million. The Warriors are expected to have to pay up to $189 million in luxury tax, bringing the total to $396 million. If the Warriors continue to sign other players to supplement the lineup, their total salary will reach or exceed US$400 million, becoming the first team in NBA history with a total salary exceeding the $400 million mark. #nbaTucaoConference##nba#",,,,"NBA Tucao Conference, nba",0,0,0,7/10/23 5:36,NBA Super Talk,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hfrd6pni3aj30rs0id405.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hfrd6q3aj2j30rq0i3n0p.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/ 006MqMwHgy1hfrd6pydbvj30p80ivwh2.jpg']",,

Poole has gone from being a cold shooter selected by the Warriors to a championship hero, and then to a full beard with the Wizards. Recently, Wizards guard Jordan Poole was interviewed, looking back on his time with the Warriors and looking forward to his future with the Washington Wizards. He shared his experiences and insights on the Warriors' championship and relationship with Curry and Thompson, while also expressing his expectations for new challenges. When talking about his experience with the Warriors, Poole said he was very satisfied because he not only won a championship ring, but also learned a lot of valuable lessons. He describes this time as a life-changing opportunity, one that he learned a lot about both on and off the court through his interactions with the Warriors players and coaching staff. These experiences not only improved Poole's basketball skills, but also made him a more mature player. Regarding his relationship with his former teammates Curry and Thompson, Poole said he is very grateful and fortunate to learn from them. He believes that Curry and Thompson are the two best shooters in history, and their shooting skills and intelligence have always been examples for him to learn from. Although Poole has left the Warriors, he stressed that his friendship with them has not changed and they still stay in touch. When talking about the impact of being punched by Draymond Green last season on his trade, Poole first expressed his excitement for his new beginning. He emphasized that he is now a member of the Washington Wizards and views working with teammate Kyle Kuzma positively. Poole believes that he and Kuzma are a great combination. They can have good understanding and outstanding performance on the court and work together to win the team. He believes that this new challenge will push them to continue to improve and make greater contributions to the team. It can be seen from Poole's interview that he did avoid this topic when talking about chasing dreams. For a young and energetic person, being beaten by a teammate and having the video seen by the whole world was hard for anyone to accept. But Poole's mentality has become somewhat mature. From the Warriors to the Wizards, he has gained new opportunities in the process. Past experiences have shaped his personal abilities and mentality, allowing him to better adapt and integrate into the new team. The combination of Kuzma and Poole, who have unlimited firing rights next season, is still a bit exciting. #nbaTucaoConference##nba#",,,,"NBA Tucao Conference, nba",0,0,0,7/10/23 5:07,NBA Super Talk,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hfrccloqz9j30u011in1z.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hfrcclwb6yj30u011in4v.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/ 006MqMwHgy1hfrcclm5nej30u011h0wb.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hfrccll55cj30u011i41n.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hfrcclmhfbj30 u011bdil.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg. cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hfrcclun2ej30u011iwik.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hfrcclwwtij30u011itdz.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hfrcclyy8uj 30u00u0q8t.jpg', 'https:// wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hfrcclsay0j30u011in1x.jpg']",,

Stone said that the Rockets signed VanVleet as a lucky opportunity because he combines many advantages with almost no obvious shortcomings. Stone went on to add that Dillon is considered the best defensive player on a team and is known for his high defensive intensity and aggressive style of play. Stone praised him for his outstanding performance in past games and making important contributions to the team's defense. VanVleet is considered an excellent organizer and off-ball shooter.

Good news: Reddish's TS and EFG this season are both career highs. Although compared with himself, the overall efficiency is still inferior, but at least it is improving. Good news: Reddish is a forward with good size, excellent athletic ability, good explosive power, and his ball-handling ability also supports him to complete some difficult layups. This kind of ""hard solution ability"" is what teams competing for the championship need. Good news: 23 Reddish played an excellent defensive influence in the Trail Blazers. The team lost 4.2 points less per 100 possessions and the opponent's shooting percentage in sports games dropped by 2.7%, exceeding 84% and 89% of players respectively. Although the sample size is not large, considering Reddish's size and stealing ability have always been good, playing in the Lakers, which has a higher defensive level, he has the opportunity to show his defensive value in a large sample size. Bad news: Reddish is nicknamed the ""Ice Shooter"". In addition to his low offensive efficiency, he has basically been one of the players with the worst offensive impact throughout his career. This season in the Trail Blazers, he scored 8.1 fewer points per 100 possessions (only more than 9% of the players), and this is not the first time he has delivered an exaggerated offensive performance. Bad news: Reddish never passes the ball and his style of play is extremely selfish. As mentioned earlier, his advantage is that he can score some difficult singles, and this combined with his lack of passing ability, if used improperly, is like a dagger with the tip pointed inward. Bad news: Reddish's three-point shooting is very poor. Last season, he took 6.6 shots and a mediocre 36% shooting rate in 36 minutes. This season, it dropped to 5.1 shots and a 31.7% shooting rate. Of course he doesn't have so many opportunities to play freely in the Lakers, but even if he is purely used as a fixed-point response, he is still unqualified.

4.92E+15,N8Ydyg5vU,1808638663,Citizen Uitler,"2023 Rockets Summer League G1 Observation 1. Thompson, what is impressive is that he is very calm on the court. He is not like a young boy who has just played in the professional league. He knows what he should do on the court, has a decent offensive organization, and can score breakthrough points. He is very skilled at finding shooters from the bottom corner. The first step starts very quickly, and he knows how to change speeds and has the ability to accelerate suddenly. He looks much calmer than when Green played in the Summer League. The defensive end didn't panic at all when retreating. He was very impressive when he stole the ball twice. He had quick hands and didn't commit any fouls. The pace of finishing on the offensive end needs to be improved. After entering the small penalty area, he basically jumped directly to finish with a throw. The pace was very unclear. Although it was indeed fast, due to lack of strength, he still shot early before reaching the basket. It will definitely affect efficiency. In the second quarter, I tried playing on the wing and squatting in the corner, but it basically had no impact and the ball couldn't be passed. I didn't try again in the half. Amen's passing is really good. His vision and passing skills are obviously developed after a long period of training. When he found an opportunity, he passed the ball very quickly~ If Huff hadn't been too useless, he would have had a few more assists... 2. White Devil, intuitively feels like he's not that big, and he doesn't look taller standing next to the 6'5 Sharp. After a match, I felt that his shape was not very similar to Martin's... He didn't seem to have the scary vertical jumping power of Martin. Martin was just like a spring, while White Devil was just strong and his bounce was average, without the feeling of flying into the sky. It's true that he is a bit lonely. He can't get the ball back when he gets it. Most of the time he ends it directly and the efficiency is very low. If he can't perform efficiently in air cuts, his performance in the new season will not be very good... Passing Awareness is slow and skills are lacking. On the defensive end, he was more active. He played 2 in the opening game and chased Sharp well, but he did take cover. 3. Ethan feels a lot stronger, his shoulders are bulging, he is as reckless as ever, he hits the boards again, and his three-point shooting is also good. The surprise is that he also had 5 assists in this game. But I still can't get up from the basket, 2 times... And I also played a few times as the main attacker, and I also know how to break through and pass to the bottom corner. It seems to have a feeling of having a light ~ I don't know if it is an illusion ~ In the second half, there were a few breakthroughs and dunks Oh my god, he looks like a heavy forward. If this guy can practice shooting, it would be pretty scary. 4. Smith, although he got high scores, actually the least he can say is that he should focus less on holding the ball and focus on shooting. If you do this part well, you will be very good. Don't always think about advanced tasks such as dribbling and breakthrough. It's really not good~~ Others can't say much. Huff doesn't have the ability to play in the league, so he can only use it in the summer league. Yes, but the frame protection is really good. Thompson's injury seems to be fine, but I still feel very sad because I can't see it in the summer league... I hope to give Mayer some opportunities at the end of the game. It's not interesting to play all the rotations today and there is no possibility of staying on the team. .. Let me say one more thing about Henderson. He played really well in the first quarter. He was calm and composed and had a general demeanor. He is quite a traditional core point guard holding the ball. However, the offense still relies too much on touch. He disappeared in the second quarter. In the third He was immediately injured and retired. However, the Blazers are very lucky to be able to find the core for future training in the first year of reconstruction. Usually this step is the most difficult thing in the early stage of reconstruction... In this regard, they are much luckier than the Rockets... #Houston Rockets##nbaoffseason##nbasummerleague#",,,,"houston rockets,nba offseason,nba summer league",1,25,59,7/9/23 0:02,Weibo web version,,,

The Lakers announced that free agent Reddish joined the team on a two-year, $4.63 million contract with a player option for the second year. In the 22-23 season, Reddish played for the Knicks and Trail Blazers respectively, averaging 9.7 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game, while shooting only 31.3% from three-point range. Reddish is also known as the ""Ice Shooter"". From the perspective of player type, he is a shooter, but Reddish is a player with very low shooting efficiency. Therefore, even though he is very young, he has also been in trouble in recent years. NBA wandering. The Lakers signed Reddish with a two-year contract, probably hoping that Reddish can help the Lakers on the defensive end. He is tall and can play good defense. As for the offensive end, judging from Reddish's performance in the past few years, don't expect him to become a scorer averaging 20+ per game. Moreover, at critical moments, Reddish's three-point shooting rate is not even as good as James.

Zion Williamson. 29 turnovers and 31 fouls, but this is Summer League so there’s no need to make too much of a fuss , if the fight continues like this, the two-way position may not be guaranteed. .Dyson has improved slightly on the offensive end. Although he is shaking really hard, and there is still a problem of collecting the ball early, he is willing to try to get the ball into the middle zone. He has used European steps to create space several times, and he can also get in when double-teamed. Passing the ball away before being pinched is considered acceptable. Keep observing. The defensive end is still there, but there was a period of time in the second quarter when he was distracted without the ball and made several consecutive defensive mistakes. But I believe he will tighten up in the regular season. .Hawkins seems to have no problem. He is willing to take the shot and there is almost no issue of shot selection in this game. It is indeed very good to have such a running shooter, but 1 of 6 free throws is completely failed. .EJL didn’t have a chance to be a cover in this game, and the playing time seemed to be under control. This time, there were more transitions and attacks. We will see if they will try other things in the future. There is no big problem with defense. Anyone who has not encountered NBA level will watch it. Not too surprising. Carlo has not made much progress. His statistics in Europe are mediocre. I was not very optimistic about him in the first place. The chance of entering the NBA should be quite small. .This summer league seems to have no bright spots. In the past few years, Naji, TM3 and others have performed well. This time, no one seems to be able to handle it. I was originally looking forward to Westbourne, but in the next few games, I will look at Liam Rowe. Whether Binns can play or not, I am looking forward to his performance.

To become a defensive leader, he has a very good height and body shape, and a solid foundation in moving and sliding. What he needs is to develop a better sense of position and defensive literacy, and strive to be the defensive leader at positions 1-3. 3. Movement control ability. Summer League has many highlights in singles with the ball, but I don’t expect him to become the second Rivers. The Lakers’ regular lineup may not have so many movement control opportunities for him to practice. Of course, it would also be good if there are easter eggs. . 4. Increase the shooting speed.

The Guangdong team must improve the team's lineup this offseason. They cannot continue to use the current lineup to play next season. In this way, it will be difficult for the team to perform well. This season, the Guangdong team has shown its own strength. The shortcomings of the lineup, especially the young players in the team, they are simply not able to stand alone. This is definitely not possible. The Guangdong team must perform better to have a chance to regain the CBA League championship. At least it seems now. The rotation players in the Guangdong team were not strong enough, and they finally decided to propose a blockbuster deal. The team wanted to trade the No. 1 pick Chen Guohao from the Beijing Control Team. If the Guangdong team can sign Chen Guohao, the team's forward lineup will be very solid. They can make up for the loss of Zhou Peng's departure. Now the Guangdong team only has a relatively reliable player in the third position, Zhang Haojia. The performance of other players is not particularly outstanding. The Guangdong team intends to exchange two players, Wang Xinkai and Zhang Hao, for Chen Guohao. The team's sincerity is very sufficient. Wang Xinkai himself is a very important shooter in the Guangdong team. He can at least serve as A rotation-level player in the CBA league, and Zhang Hao has certain potential, he deserves to be well cultivated by the Beikong team. The Beikong team should consider completing this deal with the Guangdong team. After all, Chen Guohao has not proven his ability in the CBA league. It is almost the same for him to just replace Zhang Hao, but the Guangdong team also gave Wang Xinkai a player. The Beikong team will certainly not lose money if they agree to this deal. Both players can enter the Beikong team's rotation. They are equivalent to exchanging Ma Yong and Wang Junjie for Wang Xinkai and Zhang Hao. To be honest, if the Beikong team If you directly propose such a deal to the Guangdong team, the other party will definitely reject it. They don't need Ma Yong and Wang Junjie at all, but the player Chen Guohao is different. The second news from Guangdong University of Technology forward player Chen Guohao comes from Liaoning team forward player Zhang Zhenlin. He recently represented the Chinese men’s basketball team in the European training warm-up match. In the two warm-up matches against the Croatian men’s basketball team, Zhang Zhenlin scored a total of 41 points. , his personal ability has been recognized by the fans, and in these two games, Zhang Zhenlin was the player with the most points in the Chinese men's basketball team. He has now completely announced his rise and has become the main offensive point of the Chinese men's basketball team. After two games, Zhang Zhenlin has basically confirmed his strong position on the offensive end. Now the defenders of the Chinese men's basketball team are not very strong in scoring. They mainly rely on forward players and inside players to score. This will be a serious problem. The problem is, in world competitions, our defenders are not as good as players from strong European teams in terms of height and confrontation. This is definitely not possible. Defenders must also show their scoring ability in the CBA league. Even if naturalized player Li Kai will join in the future, the Chinese men's basketball team must have defenders to step up and play the main offensive position. Zhang Zhenlin's offensive ability with the ball has always been a shortcoming, and there must be players who can rely on breakthroughs for teammates. Create offensive space. The European training competition of the Chinese men's basketball team has just begun. There will be more powerful opponents waiting for the players. I hope Zhang Zhenlin can perform better and he may grow significantly. The third news about Zhang Zhenlin, the main forward player of the Chinese Men's Basketball Team, comes from the inside player Zhou Qi of the Chinese Men's Basketball Team. In the second warm-up match against the Croatian Men's Basketball Team, Zhou Qi played on behalf of the Chinese Men's Basketball Team, but after the first half of the game , he unexpectedly left the field due to injury, which made the fans very worried. Fortunately, everyone was just a false alarm. In the second half of the game, Zhou Qi returned from injury and started again. After the whole game, he scored 13 In terms of points and 10 rebounds, this performance is quite satisfactory. Although Zhou Qi's scoring is not as good as Zhang Zhenlin, his role in the entire game is irreplaceable. Zhou Qi can bring huge help to the Chinese men's basketball team. His abilities are very comprehensive, and now Zhou Qi is still Unable to exert all his strength, after all, he has not played a formal game for a long time. Zhou Qi needs to adapt to the rhythm of the game. There is still one month left before the World Cup. During this time, Zhou Qi must improve his state. get back. Zhou Qi is currently the strongest inside player in the Chinese men's basketball team. He can help the team on both the offensive and defensive ends. Whether Zhou Qi's performance is stable will directly determine the performance of the Chinese men's basketball team in the World Cup. Although In the future, the core player of the Chinese men's basketball team will most likely be Li Kai, but Zhou Qi is also an indispensable player in the team. This time, his injury is not a big problem. This is a blessing among misfortunes. Next, the players must pay attention to protecting their bodies during the warm-up match. Zhou Qi, the former Xinjiang team's main inside player, now has a very complete roster of Chinese men's basketball players. All the capable players in the league have been assembled. However, compared with the world's top teams, the current strength of the Chinese men's basketball team is still not enough. , in two warm-up games against the Croatian men's basketball team, the Chinese men's basketball team lost both games, and this was the second Croatian team. You must know that the Croatian men's basketball team has many players from the NBA league. They did not participate in the warm-up match against the Chinese men's basketball team. Most of the Croatian men's basketball team this time are players who play in the European league. Even so, the Chinese men's basketball team It is also difficult to beat the opponent. Maybe after Li Kai joins the team, the Chinese men's basketball team will have a chance to win.",,,,,0,0,1,7/17/23 0:25,Redmi Note 8 quad camera,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/a13858cdgy1hfz7j6jmx5j20u00jdqgm.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/a13858cdgy1hfz7j6vdmbj20u00kawp5.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/ large/ a13858cdgy1hfz7j7gw1cj20u00k1k3f.jpg']",,

Very excited, very nervous, all the feelings intertwined. I'm ready to train with the team. It's a little awkward to be on the sidelines and not be able to participate in training, but we've been doing other training and just because I can't be involved in training doesn't mean I can't learn. -- Lively being able to learn from a player (Tyson Chandler) who is so good and knows the position so well is an asset. He was probably tired of my frequent questions. We work a lot on catching the ball, and as a 7-foot-1 big man, I have to be able to use my size to catch the ball. Sometimes you get nervous or overthink things when you're facing smaller defenders, and that's why you need a big guy like TC here, I can ask him, (and he'll tell me) don't be afraid to make mistakes. ——Liveley They will be thrown into the furnace. First, they need to establish a chemical reaction with the other starting players. Both of them will definitely be the starters in the Summer League. In the first Summer League game against the Thunder, there was nothing better than this. A better chance is that there are six or seven players on the NBA roster on the opposite side. - Dudley I'm excited to play, I haven't played 5-on-5 since the combine a few months ago. It's the first time to put on an NBA jersey, which will be even more exciting. It's a little tough just watching from the sidelines, but we've been doing everything we can to stay in shape and we're ready for Friday's training and Saturday's game. - Prosper O Web Link I will keep him (Liveley) ready because you can generally see his learning ability and he is a very good player. The best thing is defensively, he's able to protect the paint, switch and do it all. For them, the mental stuff will outweigh the physical stuff these days, and then they'll play five games in Las Vegas. - Dudley They're both big, and when they come on the scene they bring their size, which I don't think will scare a lot of people, but make them think twice. Drake (Liveley) asked me and Jaden (Hardy) today how we want him to run the pick-and-roll to get us open. I said, as long as you can shake off the defender, I will give you the ball. He said, no, I don't care about myself. He just wanted Jaden and me to get open shots. It's important to hear that in his rookie season and I'm looking forward to getting on the court with these guys. ——McKinley Wright IV’s guests on the sidelines of Wednesday’s practice were TCU coach Jamie Dixon, under whom Mike Myers Jr., the Mavericks’ signing, spent three years in college. There's also University of Georgia coach Tom Crean, whose son Riley is a video analyst for the Mavericks. After practice on Wednesday, the team gathered around Hardy and sang him happy birthday. Hardy is 21 years old. Burns' 80 steals in his freshman season were the second-most on the team. He's a Houston guy: I kind of knew my odds of being drafted were low, but that didn't mean I wasn't a good player compared to anybody. At the end of the day, if I don't score, I don't rebound, but you can see the energy from me. I can ignite some people. I think what I bring is mainly intangible things and energy. I just feel like I can be the glue for this team. Whatever you want me to do, I will do it, I can work hard, I am willing to work hard, and I will even work day and night if you need it. O Web link Last season, Bingham was ready to play for the Texas Legends, the Mavericks G-League affiliate. His jersey number was all set. Then he injured his ankle and required surgery, which took five months. Recovery: I'm still recovering, but I feel great and everything is fine. I've been sitting at home for almost the entire year, so all I need now is to get back up and ready to play a real game. Summer League opener against Holmgren? We all have something to prove. It will be fun to play against a player like that. He's a 7-footer who can shoot in the pick-and-pop and disrupt a lot of shots at the basket. I played with him in preseason camp last year, so I know what he can do. ——McKinley Wright IV Bingham holds the Michigan State school record with 168 blocked shots. The previous record holder was Tillman of the Grizzlies. O's web link undrafted Mike Myers Jr.: I don't have to go anywhere, I grew up 20 minutes away from here, so that's a blessing. Myers is a good player for us because of his aggressiveness, or, attack. - Dudley I'm just playing my game and obviously, everyone knows I'm going to be offensive. It's just that people don't think I can shoot that well. But the truth is I can shoot the ball. I can say I'm a very good shooter. I just want to show everyone my game and show them that I'm a good player. - Miles You can see his basketball IQ, he's been in college longer than most, so he's a good offensive talent, especially in the summer league. ——Dudley I really think he is a very good defender. He has the ability to create matchup advantages and hit open shots, so I think he is a very good defender. He's one of those guys who can hit the shot when space is needed. ——Hardy O web link",,,,,0,1,13,7/7/23 14:56,mavschina super talk,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfoc02im02j20u011iad7.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfoc00kxygj21hc0u0nch.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/ 87dd6bf7gy1hfoc00nwk4j21hc0u0k6v.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfoc29iuv0j20u011i0xt.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfoc3ezjugj2 18z0u0wit.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg. cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfoc3b0bf4j20u011in33.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfoc3bw2n4j20u011in3u.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfoc39ld h5j20u011iafh.jpg', 'https:// wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hfoci91jepj20u011itdb.jpg']",,

He wanted to lure the forward to join, but Lukaku actually believed it. He directly refused to answer calls from Inter Milan and discussed the possibility of joining Juventus. But now it seems that Juventus has also played a trick on Lukaku, because Vlahovic has no way to sell it. Therefore, Juventus does not have the space or funds to sign Lukaku.

""It went viral on social media, but it was certainly different seeing it from four or five feet away. Outside the Lakers locker room after the championship, of course there was champagne all over the room, and I remember Kyle - Kuzma was celebrating wildly, spraying champagne everywhere. But LeBron came out of the locker room, picked up his cell phone, and called his wife, Savannah, and then his mother, Gloria. Finally, they started a FaceTime video call. When I came to his side, reporters gathered around him. He was lying on his back, smoking a cigar in his mouth, crossing his legs, and he raised his mobile phone to make a FaceTime call. . He was on the phone with his mother. ""I'm paraphrasing here, but that's really what he said, 'Mom, that's not bad for a kid from Akron.' We have come a long way. 'It was great because he made it about mother and son, he said we did this, we did that. He was expressing his gratitude to his mother. This is certainly not his first championship, but you can see how special this is to him, to be able to win a championship for Los Angeles, to be able to overcome all the difficulties in the park to win a championship, to be able to win the third team in his illustrious career.

4.92E+15,N8FcslTwR,6748483996,Qiu Mo Austin,"#400人计划#No.40BuddyHield Pacer, forward, 30-year-old career year! Hield, who has always been known as a marksman, made a strong comeback after a brief shooting slump. He took 9.8 shots in 36 minutes and hit 42.7%. Only Curry has a higher three-point productivity than him. In addition to continuing his already accurate open three-pointers (47.6%), he also improved his always unstable three-pointers with the ball to 43.8% (easily a career high), making him a true top-level shooting threat. He averaged 17 points per game as a secondary attacker next to Haliburton, and his efficiency was very good. Before this season, Hilder's career TS was 56% and EFG was 54%, which cannot be called efficient (mainly due to efficiency other than three-pointers); this season, his TS has reached 62.3% and EFG is 60%, which greatly improves his efficiency. Normally, Hield has the right size to play as a defender and is definitely short to play as a forward; but he happened to have the highest DLEBRON and defensive plus-minus of his career in the season when he played as a forward for the first time in his career. This season, he defends less defenders, more forwards and even more interior liners. His strong frame plays a role and rarely commits fouls. His frame protection effect is also surprisingly good (opponents' shooting percentage at the basket dropped by 4.2%, which is higher than 88% of players). It's hard to say how much peace Hield was whitewashed by Jaylen Smith and Turner, because the Pacers' rim protection in the lineup of Hield + Nesmith playing four was terrible. Even though his defensive statistics are generally the best in his career, he is still around the average defensive level and is still a player who is strong in offense and weak in defense. Hield has made a career-high 288 three-pointers this season. If he makes 276 three-pointers in each of the next five years (the average of the past five years), by the age of 35 he will have a chance to hit the top five in history in three-pointers made.

4.92E+15,N8tFEbudP,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[The Tragedy of the Four Little Swans] Poole, Hero, and Maxi are always put in the same discussion topic. Due to the close type, Anfernee Simons is sometimes included. They have two things in common: first, they are combo guards who score points and have poor defense; second, they were ""born"" on a winning team. Turning the time back to the end of 2021, the Warriors, Heat, and 76ers each demonstrated their ambitions to advance to the conference finals. This is why Poole, Herro, and Maxey gained their destiny at that time. Their respective rises have become the X factor for teams in the first half of the playoffs. Generally speaking, it is not easy for teams in this position to have a 20-year-old who can play with the ball and has a possession rate of about 25%. A rookie who consistently gets 30 minutes of playing time. Being able to compete for the championship and having young developers rise to the top sounds like a wonderful story. But as long as you recall the public opinion at the time, you should realize that the collapse did not happen suddenly - concerns about Poole, Herro, and Maxi have always existed, and no one is optimistic that Simmons will take over the mantle of CJ and form a team with Lillard again. Double guns. They've always been the X factor, not just because of their youth, but because of their uncertain playing style. What's the most unflattering position on the basketball court? A guard who can't defend and can't play point guard. Such a player cannot provide matchup flexibility, cannot lead and defend the opposite arrow, cannot drive the team's overall offense, and has little game value other than scoring. ""Pure backcourt shooters"" and ""combo guards"" often fall into this category. When Joe Harris and Dun Luo fail to make three-pointers, the Heat and Nets will regret it, but after all, they have not received a contract with a starting salary reaching 20% of the salary cap. The pricing of pure shooters has its upper limit. But a ""combo guard"" who can't defend, and who is called a ""double guard"" but can't actually play a real point guard, has a greater role in the game. They play in more positions than pure shooters and require more resources. They are usually shooters, but their space value without the ball is not as high as that of a full-time shooter. They have the skills to develop with the ball, but their talent does not support a large number of hard tackles. They need tactical support, but they cannot drag the whole team in the process. The final ""KPI"" to examine them is scoring and scoring efficiency, as well as how many turnovers they made in the process. In addition, their offensive methods include a considerable proportion of jump shots - the frequency of shots beyond 14 feet is 58% for Herro, 57% for Poole, 64% for Simmons Jr., and 46% for Maxi - when the touch is struggling, even compared to pure shooters Having more scoring options may not save a disastrous night. The league is wary of this type of player, otherwise Clarkson's new contract would not only be worth 55 million for three years, and this price is comparable to that of a premium full-time shooter. In the 20-21 season, Sexton averaged 24.3 points per game and had a true shooting percentage of 57.3%. He staged an amazing one-British game against three Lu Bu. However, the Cavaliers took a lot of trouble to renew his contract. In the end, they had to let him go due to trade needs. The Jazz took over, and the four-year contract did not exceed 20 million until the last season. Sexton suffered injuries in the crucial fourth year and only played 11 games. This kind of thing in the contract year is not conducive to negotiations, but the interesting part is not here - the Cavaliers have no plans to play in Sexton's third year. Offer an early contract extension at the end of the game, and generally speaking, you wouldn't let the 8th overall pick who averaged 24.3 points per game become a restricted free agent to increase the risk of market bidding. So far, the Cavaliers have no reason to regret. Looking at it this way, the Warriors and the Heat do seem to be taking advantage of each other. They spent a lot of money on a type that can easily overturn, and the Warriors really overturned, and the Heat are also frowning - look at who Herro was in the trading market. Looking disgusted, and then thinking about the black eight journey that had just advanced to the finals, Shiro only participated in the opening ceremony of this magnificent epic. The cheaper Anfernee Simons isn't much better. He secretly averaged the highest points per game in his career in Portland, where no one cared about him. He has the craziest shooting ability among the four little swans. Although his appearance in the dunk contest was embarrassing, it also proved him from the side. Excellent physical fitness. However, this is of no use. He is still too thin and his compatibility with Lillard is not better than that of CJ. The Trail Blazers' new version of the two-gun experiment completely failed. If Lillard stays on the team (this assumption no longer exists), Simmons must be a bargaining chip. Lillard left the team, and he was not part of the core list of the Trail Blazers' rebuild - the Trail Blazers said they would rebuild around Henderson and Sharpe. Both Plan 1.0 and Plan 2.0, Simmons was disliked. Maxi is better than the other three. He has a higher percentage of shots at the rim, which is based on visible explosive speed. He also has a defensive weakness. Compared to the other three brothers, the coach will let him try some difficult matchups. Although he is the shortest, he is the largest, and his lightning-fast counterattacks can highlight his excellent physical ability. But that's not important. The key is positioning: take away Harden, give the ball to Maxi, and let him play a two-man game with the Emperor. Can he be successful? Although in a small sample, when Harden is not on the court and Embiid and Maxi are on the court, the 76ers have good offensive data, but extending the time to a season, the expectations seem to be pessimistic - in the face of delays, Mark Can you give me Xi’s ball? If the opponent bypasses the Emperor, or uses a tall man to cover Maxi's ball route, can he get the ball to the Emperor in the important position? At least so far, Maxi has not proven that he has the potential to transform into the No. 1 position. So Gouzi breathed a sigh of relief - okay, okay, Maxi is one or two years younger than the other three little swans, Lei, you guys helped me, I won't be polite. Although the 76ers have strongly expressed their attitude not to send Maxi away, they have no intention of offering him an early contract extension now. This is very intriguing. The technical consideration is that renewing Maxi's contract in advance now will trigger a poison clause that is difficult to balance. Even if the subtext of ""retaining tradeability in the next year"" is not considered, the 76ers may not want to copy the experiences of the Warriors and Heat. You have to be careful about signing contracts with ""guards who can't defend and can't play point guard."" Management will remember this principle more strongly after being beaten severely, or seeing others get beaten. Of course, if we turn back the time by a year and look at it from the perspective of the Warriors and Heat, we can still find reasons for them, at least the Warriors' reasons are quite sufficient. This is what Poole looked like in the summer of 2022: In the playoffs that year, Poole averaged 17 points per game, shot 39.1% from three-point range, and had a true shooting percentage of 65.4%. What is the concept of scoring efficiency? In the 2022 playoffs, among the 21 players with a total playing time of more than 500 minutes, Poole ranks second in true shooting percentage, and Horford, who ranks first, basically only does catch and shoot; in other words, this year's playoffs No player can beat Poole in both possession percentage and true shooting percentage; he has two explosive series, and two series with mixed reviews but highlight games to help win the game. Don't underestimate the frequency of such outbreaks. In 2021, Middleton had one round of highlights and one round of hip-stretching. Two rounds were quite satisfactory, not much more stable than Poole. The most important thing is that Poole's outbreak has a fairly clear growth trajectory and technical preparation. From the beginning, Kong had bold shooting choices without a crosshair, to gradually sending out highlight games with consecutive three-pointers, to steadily contributing to open responses and frequently scoring difficult goals. From being only regarded as an off-ball attacker who mainly plays jump shots, to being able to show aggression with agile cuts and stunning finishes, to the integration of ball-handling skills and positioning awareness, he inherited the Warriors' backcourt style of switching with and without the ball. One step at a time, one step at a time, with the league's No. 1 free throw shooting percentage, soft wrist feel, and ability to get to the free throw line, you believe that his outbreak is not a flash in the pan. He has the ability to guarantee the output, and even has the opportunity to change. For example, he will occasionally show his coquettish ball awareness and provide greater energy in a larger role. These are all potential growth directions. Therefore, it is completely understandable that the Warriors will pay for Poole in 2022. Poole's growth curve was quite optimistic at the time, which led to the expectation that Poole will be more popular in the free market one year later. So, what does a better Poole look like? There are two options for the growth of players in this category: the first is to grow into a super scorer with no blind spots. Mitchell may be the ceiling of this category in the current league. After he has made up for his shortcomings in finishing near the basket, there are basically no scoring dead spots. This is why LaVine is not as good as Mitchell in a certain space and starting style. With support, there is unlimited power. But Mitchell is something that the Four Little Swans cannot learn from. Although he is only 1.85 meters tall, he does weigh 98kg (Maxi, the heaviest of the Four Little Swans, is 91kg). His latissimus dorsi, deltoid muscles, and triceps brachii are exploding. Nearly unlimited physical ability. The four little swans can't do this even if they go to the gym every day; the second type is to transform into the No. 1 position. Since he is in the No. 1 position, his style of play requires frequent pick-and-roll calls, and he lacks the talent to solve one-on-one situations, so he simply transforms into the No. 1 position to solve the problems of defensive compatibility and tactical positioning. However, these ""soft skills"" such as passing vision and awareness of reading the game are difficult to practice. There are few successful cases of the No. 2 position transforming into the No. 1 position in the league. At certain moments in the 21-22 season, Simmons Jr. showed the potential to transform into the No. 1 position. In the end, these potentials remained on the surface and have not yet been fully realized. Poole is indeed eye-catching when passing the ball, but as long as the Warriors put him in the organizer's position, it is more likely that the number of turnovers will be completely uncontrollable. Whether it's Poole or the other three Little Swans, they have prospects, but their physical talent and awareness of reading the game are there. They need to take a step closer and lack a ready-made template. so what? So the Warriors and Heat still believe that the situation will be different here. Indeed, the Warriors and Heat are so special. They have the best technical and tactical preparations and habits in the league. They disperse organizational work in different positions and do not force scorers to make frequent hard tackles. Compared to go-it-alone guys like Sexton who really don’t have a passing key, you can also see more of a sense of team from Poole and Herro. They can be embedded in the team system, as long as they can hit jumpers, By cutting in at the right time and correctly using the opportunity for individuals to change defense to release the ball, their comprehensive game ability will be released. On the other hand, these two teams are very good at small ball defense. They will use the team's integrity to make up for their size disadvantage, so that Poole and Herro can be protected on this end. The above belief is by no means a fantasy. The Warriors led Poole to win the championship. When he, Curry, and Thompson set off a tsunami storm, were you also amazed by the stormy attack waves in the golden ocean at Chase Center? The Heat have reached the finals with Hiero, and Hiero, who has played brilliantly in the park for 20 years, is only a first-year student. It is impossible not to look forward to such a youthful explosion. Hiero is indeed getting better after a year of stagnation. We also have to consider the reality that for a team that's unlikely to have cap space anytime soon, you can't afford to miss out on homegrown talent. Even if you don't include Poole and Herro in your long-term plan, as long as you don't plan to send them away before the end of their rookie contract - the Heat used Herro as a bargaining chip in countless ""intentions"", but never succeeded, and returned to 22 In the summer of last year, except for the fans who just wanted to talk, no one had the courage to directly send Poole away as the Warriors general manager - then, provide an early contract extension to ensure that he will have a contract for a long time in the future. A valuable asset is the decision to follow the trend. Okay, the buffs are stacked: it seems there is still potential to be tapped; the team's special tactical system; a successful cooperation experience in the playoffs; experience on the highest stage; the non-cap team does not want to lose valuable assets. They showed up at the right time to help a playoff team that was hard to bolster. They came to the renewal window at the wrong time, leaving the management helpless with the exploding payroll. The world has a wonderful balance of luck that won't let you take advantage. Therefore, the consequence of not wanting to lose assets is to lose more assets. Poole really lost his shooting aim. As a result, he shot 33.6% from three-point range (25.4% in the playoffs). As a result, he was unable to make up for his damage in other areas by scoring. The Warriors' worsening physical configuration further worsened the situation. Poole's defensive incompatibility was amplified. Since the team can only provide full-service tactical positioning for Poole during Curry's absence, and only at this time there is a strong demand for his ability to carry production, this makes Poole's value to the Warriors even more limited, but he brings The damage was truly felt in every minute of the scene. ""A guard who can't defend and can't play point guard"", no matter how many successful cooperation experiences you have, no matter how inclusive the offensive and defensive system you have, it is difficult not to admit that once the skills of such players expire, everything about them will be lost. All the beautiful visions will disappear. In the end, Poole just got a contract that was likely to be waived if the Warriors didn't make a move. And Poole has achieved the team status he wanted. He will become the Wizards' offensive arrow and take more ball rights. But the Wizards have no inside support points, and no system to help him play hand-offs after releasing the ball. He has to face more stringent defense, which requires him to play more resolutely. If he continues to try poor forced breakthroughs, he may trigger more The more mistakes he makes, the more mid-range pick-and-rolls he needs. He will also encounter more double attacks. Jones's dealing and his good running without the ball can deal with this situation to a certain extent, but the test of the timing of the ball is still inevitable. Whether he can make those people who are waiting to see the Warriors' jokes succeed depends on whether he can improve in mid-range and ball shooting. Of course, this premise is that he has to find some three-point touch and put the basics first. Hold still. As for Hiero and Simmons Jr., they may also change their careers. I'm not worried about their ability to develop pick-and-roll jumpers, but they have basically reached the upper limit of their respective offensive capabilities. Are they Clarkson who woke up earlier, or Malik Monk who had better luck? You signed a good contract after your potential exploded before the best premium opportunity of your career arrived? Getting 30 minutes of starting treatment, but there is no guarantee that there will be a starting or key ball position. Perhaps, this is their most reasonable way to use it. The more suitable price for such a player should not exceed 20 million. Gouzi saw all this, so Maxi may be the biggest loser. Is this all tragedy? 1.98 meters, 101kg, full of tendons, able to complete beautiful pull-ups and laybacks in the middle distance. He can dunk like a cheetah on fast breaks and can switch to guard the No. 3 overall pick in multiple positions. Anyway, it can’t be put in this category, right? Yes, if he is placed in the position of leading the opponent's wing attacker, there will be multiple starting points for holding the ball and a high-quality spatial environment around him, so that he does not need to do too many difficult ball handling, and his elder brother will take the lead to take on the main attack. Task, then, he is indeed better than the four little swans, and much more compatible. However, this does not prevent him from having a game impact similar to that of the Four Little Swans (the BPM in the 2022 playoffs was not as good as Poole's, and the 2023 playoffs was not as good as Maxi's) - if he does not help much in defense, but takes on a simpler role Leading the defensive task, at the same time, the advantage compared to the four Little Swans in developing offense is that it only has greater one-on-one value in punishing mismatches, and this opportunity only accounts for a small part of the game. So, do the Celtics really want to give Jaylen Brown a five-year, $300 million contract? Really, think about it.

4.92E+15,N8qYaigtL,5857692425,Brother Ax_AGordon,"The Nuggets Summer League has started training. Let me introduce the starting lineup of the Nuggets Summer League. 1. Guard: Colin Gillespie (6 feet 3, 190 pounds, last team played for: Denver Nuggets) Gillais Spiey had a stellar career at Villanova and signed a two-way contract with the Nuggets last summer, but he missed all of last year after suffering a broken leg in offseason training. He's been around the team all season, in training, on road trips, in the locker room, and now he's got a chance to show he's come back from injury and improved as a player. Gillespie was intriguing during last summer league. He averaged 11.2 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.2 assists in four games. 2. Guard: Jalen Pickett (6-foot-4, 202 pounds, last team: Penn State) Pickett is one of three rookies in the Nuggets' 2023 draft who will play in Las Vegas. Gase enters the game. The 23-year-old (he turns 24 in October), who is older than Nagy and Braun, comes to Denver with a game of maturity. With Bruce Brown departing in free agency, Pickett may end up getting some playing time instead of backing up point guard Reggie Jackson. A strong summer league would be the first step toward that goal. Pickett was jump-selected by the Nuggets, and he only tried out for one Nuggets team. No other team had Pickett's trial data and results and went both ways. 3. Forward and guard swingman: Julian· Strawther (6-7, 205 pounds, last team: Gonzaga), Denver's top draft pick, should earn a spot in Denver's summer league starting lineup and be ready to start at the 3 spot. Strawther was one of the best three-point shooters in last year's draft, and he will have more shooting options in Las Vegas! 4. Forward: Peyton Watson (6-foot-8, 200 pounds, last team: Denver Nuggets) From the Nuggets' perspective, Watson is the top prospect in the summer league. He was impressive at the position late last season, and heading into the offseason, he's well positioned to lock down a rotation spot next year, especially after Jeff Green left Denver in free agency. Watson should dominate in Las Vegas. If he does that, it will eliminate a lot of the anxiety surrounding the Nuggets bench. 5. Center: Ismael Camarguet (6 feet 11 inches, 220 pounds, last team played for: French Ligue 1 Paris) Camarguet, the Nuggets’ second-round pick in 2022, just played in Europe Signed a new contract and is unlikely to play for the Nuggets next season. I guess if he looks like Shaq in summer league, that might change where he goes, but I think the Nuggets want to develop him right and eventually bring him back when he's ready for real rotation time. At least that's what I've been told. He had some big moments in last year's summer league. Backup Hunter Tyson (6-foot-8, 215 pounds, Clemson graduate) As the Nuggets' third overall pick in the 2023 draft, Tyson should excel in Las Vegas. . He has a never-ending motor and can shoot threes. It's a perfect summer league formula. Grant Golden (6-foot-10, 255 pounds, last team: Grand Rapids Gold) Golden served as a backup in the Nuggets' summer league in 2022, then spent last season developing for Denver League teams play, and it’s back to another cycle this year. As a center, Golden can do a little bit of everything: score inside, rebound and pass. He had four double-digit assists and a triple-double last year. Armaan Franklin (6-foot-4, 195 pounds, last played at Virginia) Franklin comes to Denver after completing four years of college (two at Indiana University, two at Virginia). A former four-star recruit out of Indianapolis, he averaged 12.4 points, 4.1 rebounds and 1.4 assists in the league last season. Franklin has long wingspan, plays well across the board, and is an aggressive defender. Andrew Funk (6-foot-5, 188 pounds, last at Penn State) Funk made 112 3-pointers last season at Penn State. Many of those goals came with assists from his college teammate Jalen Pickett. Funk is a shooter first and foremost, starting 113 games during his five-year college career. Cassius Stanley (6-foot-5, 190 pounds, last played with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers), a former 2020 second-round pick of the Indiana Pacers, resurfaces in Denver’s summer league ball Team, he hopes to return to the NBA after spending last season in the Development League. Stanley is a former four-star prospect out of Los Angeles who spent one season at Duke before declaring for the draft. With the Pacers, Stanley participated in the 2021 Dunk Contest, but was eliminated in the first round. Amir Sims (6 feet 8 inches, 245 pounds, last played for French Ligue 1 Paris) Sims played for the Paris Basketball team last season and was teammates with Camarguet. Prior to that, he spent four seasons at Clemson, where he shared a locker room with Hunter Tyson. Last season, he averaged 13.1 points (52.1% shooting, 43.6% three-point shooting), 5.8 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. He hit a nice three-pointer. Reminds you of a poor man's version of PJ Tucker. Mark Smith (6-foot-5, 220 pounds, last team selected: Göttingen, Bundesliga) Smith was considered a major league pitching prospect coming out of high school, and his fastball emerged in the 90s, but in college He turned his full attention to basketball. He played at Illinois, Missouri and Kansas State before taking his talents to Göttingen, Germany, last year. Smith is a tall and burly guard who averaged 16.2 points (36.4% from three-point range), 6.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists last season. He has a quick shot option at position 3.

However, he was a ""defensive black hole"" on the court, and his poor defense became fatal.

4.92E+15,N8l45i6gP,2279435255,The Seventh Young Master of Hua Mansion,"Irving's contract extension evaluation TheAthletic: BBleacherReport: BTheSportingNews: A Curry's transaction evaluation TheAthletic: It's incredible that Curry Jr. signed a two-year contract for less than $10 million. The Mavericks need defensive players, and Curry Jr. can't bring them that. However, he is one of the best shooters in the league and will provide great floor spacing for Doncic and Irving. Other teams should be eager to sign him. This is definitely a ""steal"" from the free market. Rating: A+ Bleacher Report: Surrounding Irving and Doncic with as many shooters as possible should be the Mavericks' top offseason priority, and Curry Jr. is one of the best 3-point shooters ever. He takes at least 100 three-pointers every season and his three-point shooting rate exceeds 40%. Career three-point shooting percentage ranks sixth in NBA history. Interestingly, Curry Jr. and Luka were teammates. In the 19-20 season, when the two played together, the Mavericks scored 119.5 points per 100 offensive possessions. Rating: ATheSportingNews: Curry Jr. is still one of the best shooters in the league. He was solid in his previous stint with Dallas and will help Luka open the floor, despite his defensive concerns. Rating: A-$12 million over three years to bring back Powell The Athletic: I do think that price is a bit unbelievable for a player like Powell, who is not a player who should play that much time. As the team's main rotation big man, he struggled on the defensive end, even though he worked very hard. But getting a big man who can fit into the rotation for $4 million per year in free agency is valuable, and Dallas has accumulated depth at a position they struggled with. Rating: B+ Bleacher Report: Powell returns to Dallas, his home of eight years, on a friendly contract and will almost certainly serve as a backup at some point this season since Dallas drafted Lively with the 12th overall pick , Holmes and McGee are also on the roster. Powell is a good locker room presence, a respected veteran, and a solid backup at this point in his career. Dallas did a good job of signing him back, even though they were a little crowded at center. Rating: BTheSportingNews: After nine seasons in Dallas, it will be strange to see Powell in a different uniform. The Mavericks bring back a solid guy and a healthy presence in the locker room at a reasonable price. He can still play some backup roles and knows his role. Evaluation: B Exum signed with the Mavericks BleacherReport: His performance in Partizan Belgrade fully deserves the NBA's investment again. He is arguably the best player of the Partizan team. From the first day of training camp, he will become a small player. One of the better defenders on the outside, his penetration and improvement in outside shooting may make him a good support for Luka. Rating: B+ Overall CBSSports: Although people are shocked by Irving's free market situation, convincing him to sign for only three years is a victory. This is Irving, who asked to leave Brooklyn due to failed max salary negotiations with the Nets. He is capricious and could mess up the situation in many ways. If Curry Jr. can stay healthy, this contract would be a stroke of genius. Exum's signing is a nice low-risk, high-reward investment in a former high draft pick who excelled abroad. They also have some mid-level assets available, so there could be another splashy signing. The Mavericks still have a lot of work to do this offseason, but for now their moves have been largely successful.

Lillard's trade is at a deadlock: Lillard currently specifies that he wants to go to the Heat, but due to the lack of veto power on the transaction, the initiative to choose the next club is entirely in development. In other words, the Trail Blazers can choose to send Lillard to the Nets or other teams besides the Heat for a better return, and Lillard can only submit. At present, the Heat have cleared the team's back line for Lillard, but have made it clear that Butler and Adebayor are not for sale in the team, and the best offer they can provide is Herro. From this point of view, Lillard joins the Heat.

Last week, the Los Angeles Clippers decided not to exercise Gordon's $21 million contract to become a free agent next season.

Draft prediction: Mid-second round Advantages: 1. All-around ball handler. At the University of Kansas, Wilson was very involved in the movement of the ball. He can play in transition offense, post-up, pick-and-roll tactics or air cuts. 2. He is a big mismatch threat at the college level, has one hand with the ball, is faster than the big guys, and is stronger than the small guys. As long as his shooting ability can continue to improve, he is fully capable of bringing his offensive skills to the NBA level. 3. Has the potential to become a shooter. In his senior season, he shot 79.9% from the free throw line and over 40% from dribbling. 4. His broad shoulders, strong body and excellent lateral speed give him certain versatility on the defensive end. 5. Although his athletic ability is not outstanding, he is very active in rebounding. He averaged 8.3 rebounds per game in his senior season. Disadvantages: 1. The three-point shooting rate is slightly lower, especially considering that he averages 5.8 three-pointers per game, which accounts for one-third of his shots. The field goal percentage when catching open shots is 40.3%, but only 27.5% when the opponent is close to defending. The ability to resist interference in shooting needs to be improved. 2. He is not the kind of player who can work in the air, his finishing ability is limited, and he sometimes makes poor mid-range shooting attempts. 3. If you want to improve defensively, the most important thing is to strengthen your athletic ability and body, otherwise you will not be able to stand under the basket. Summary: Generally speaking, Wilson's physical talent is not outstanding, but his offensive skills add a lot to his appearance. Considering his age, what is most likely to be improved after entering the league is his physical confrontation ability and shooting ability. If he can develop a precise shooting hand, combined with Wilson's ball-handling bonus, ability to handle the ball, defend, and grab rebounds, he is expected to become the plug-and-play backup forward that every team wants to have.

Although there is some positional conflict with the existing two guards, firstly, the Rockets have not yet reached the team building stage to consider compatibility. Secondly, since they need to fill the poor line, they can sign him with a fair contract. A star player cannot always say it is a mistake, it is reasonable. But signing Dillon for 80 million in four years, signing Landale for 32 million (partially guaranteed) in four years, and signing Jeff Green for 6 million in one year are not very positive operations in my opinion. Let’s focus on Dillon. Regarding him, I once said, “If I were an NBA manager, I wouldn’t even give him a basic salary.” I admit that this sentence was a bit emotional. Dillon is a good player -- as long as he doesn't mess around. He has taken 8 three-pointers per 100 possessions in his career and has a shooting percentage of 34%. He is a standard pseudo-shooter. Considering his defensive ability, this is actually acceptable. In comparison, the three-pointers in the past three years have exceeded expectations. Smart is -2.7% and Dillon is -2.8%. The output of the two players is similar. You know, Smart's three-year contract with an average salary of about 20 million has been sold to two first-rounders this year, which is a very positive asset. Dillon's biggest problem is that he overstepped his authority too seriously. His career USG% is 23%, and his TS% is only 51%. Last season, his three main offensive methods plus handoffs totaled 8.3 times per 100 rounds, with a comprehensive scoring rate of only 0.78 - equivalent to a 39% shooting rate. The more he plays, the more damage he does to the team, and he loves it. If no one on the team was forced to do this in the early years, then it is really inexplicable to do this around Morant and Bane. So overall, I think that if he plays well like Smart, is good at 3D and uses some movement control and main attack skills within his ability, the price is not unacceptable (but it is impossible to make money). Can he really do it? It can only be said that the Rockets management is willing to take this risk. Landell is about the same level as Eubanks and is a usable backup center. The Suns found a replacement with a minimum salary, and Landell wanted 8 million per year. Although it is partially guaranteed, he is not young and will have difficulty improving in the future. The probability of being able to get the contract price is low. Jeff Green, another forward in the Finals who cheated into a contract. I believe his excellent physical fitness will contribute a lot of highlights, but with this money, he can sign a much better person on the market.

It's not that he doesn't want to take action, but it's really a loss if he takes action at the lowest point of the transaction. The NBA has some sophistication, but it is still a business. The past two seasons of forced players, team purges, and secret rivalries between players and teams should make people more aware of this. #NBAFreemarket##Brooklyn Nets#",,,,"NBA free agency, Brooklyn Nets",4,70,208,7/2/23 11:21,Weibo web version,['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/a5200b89ly1hfie76g3j5j20q00irjxm.jpg'],,

4.92E+15,N7RACFGEz,6088370582,Newly used products,"#湖人# The Lakers’ light-speed reinforcements shocked the market. Are the Nuggets afraid of the fierce arms race? On the first day of the player market, various signing operations were all over the place. Some teams renewed the contracts of meritorious veterans as they wished, and some teams took risks and gave out past mistakes. A big contract worth billions. But among the many teams, there are two strong teams in the Western Conference that have the most sophisticated and quick operating methods. And before the first signing day is over, these two teams are basically the undisputed winners... ...Today's number one winner is of course the Lakers. After the player market opened, they quickly signed three players in the market-Vincent, Reddish and Taurean Prince. Vincent was a major contributor to the Heat's run to the Finals last season. He has excellent ball-handling ability and a certain amount of outside attack firepower. Later last season, with his sense of energy on both ends of the court, Vincent replaced Lowry and became the Heat's main point guard. After joining the Lakers, Vincent has the ability to become a new tactical variable in the team's backcourt, and he is fully capable of filling the gap left by Schroeder's departure. As a talented youngster on the same team as Zion and Barrett at Duke University, Reddish's development in the past four years after entering the NBA has not been smooth. In the past four years, he has moved to three teams, from the Hawks to the Knicks. Then he went to the Trail Blazers but still failed to make a name for himself. So far in his career, the huge fluctuations in court efficiency have been Reddish's flaw. As a shooter last season, his three-point shooting percentage was only 31.8%. However, Reddish is only 23 years old, and it is rationally estimated that he still has good room for development. Perhaps after joining a championship team like the Lakers and partnering with James, he will have a new understanding of basketball. As for his height of 2.03 meters, his size and athletic ability are undoubtedly what the Lakers value most. Compared with Reddish, Prince is a more mature and stable third position player. At his peak, Prince once averaged a season-long three-point shooting efficiency of 41.5%. So far in his career, his average three-point shooting efficiency has remained at 37.2%. For the Lakers, who have always had weaknesses in three-point shooting, That being said, Prince is undoubtedly an ideal matchup complement. In addition to the above three signings, the Lakers also completed the contract renewal with Rui Hachimura without any delay. After one operation, the basic framework of the Zijin Army's 10-man roster has already taken shape. Of course, the Lakers' reinforcements are not over yet. According to team reporter Jovan Buha, the Lakers will fully match Reeves' contract and work hard to sign Russell back. In addition, in the player market, the Lakers will also use two veteran minimum salaries to sign free agents, and eventually assemble a complete 15-man roster. You know, since Pelinka became the boss of the Lakers, he has done a lot of high-level operations, and he has also made mistakes in some signings and transactions. But in the past three years, almost every offseason, the Lakers have been the first team to complete the lineup. As for Pei Shuai's signing this year, he has obviously made a sophisticated plan for offseason reinforcements, and he is likely to He also made use of his former star manager's network to contact his favorite players in advance. Therefore, today the Lakers once again completed a long list of reinforcements without any obstacles, and regardless of Rui Hachimura's contract extension or the signings of Vincent, Reddish and Prince, the prices were kept within a reasonable range. inside. Next, the only thing that President Pei may have to pay attention to is to prevent the team's total salary from exceeding the hard salary cap, thus limiting their use of some special cases (such as the two-year special case used by the Lakers to sign Prince, which is to avoid exceeding the hard salary cap). cannot be used without the cap). Being in the same Pacific Division, and also aiming to win the championship as their only goal next season, the Suns' reinforcement progress on the first signing day was also amazing. As soon as the market opened, they quickly reached a contract extension agreement with Damian Lee and Okogie, and successively signed four supporting players, Eubanks, Diop, Metu and Yuta Watanabe. In just a few hours, they have already assembled a 15-man roster for next season. In fact, since Durant was traded for Durant in the middle of last season, the Suns' new boss Ishbia has focused on ""fast"" in terms of team building. During this offseason, while other teams were still slowly formulating their signing plans, the Suns had already pressed the trade button early, sending Paul away in exchange for the Wizards' leading scorer Beal. Now, the Suns have confirmed their roster for next season at the speed of light. Obviously, Ishbia no longer wanted to spend too much time on personnel operations or struggle too much. He quickly determined the team's roster and reserved enough time for the coaching staff headed by Vogel. Get familiar with the players and lineup, and develop a fully detailed tactical plan for next season. Next, the only opportunity for the Suns to appear on the market may be related to trade negotiations surrounding Ayton. With the rapid updates of the Lakers and Suns rosters, the Western Division has entered into a three-legged situation to some extent. At least for now, the Nuggets, as the defending champions, have not made any major reinforcements. On the contrary, Bruce Brown, the team's champion in the championship, has switched to the Pacers and received a big contract. Facing the fierce arms race between the Lakers and Suns, have the Nuggets already felt tremendous pressure? #nbaTucaoConference#",,,,"Lakers, nba complaints conference",0,1,3,7/1/23 17:19,Weibo web version,['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006E2bjwgy1hfhixozt14j30hb0b6js7.jpg'],,

Won the Rockets. At this time, the Warriors had three young men who gave the brothers who insisted on watching the bad season a bright feeling: they were the rookie Pascal who scored 30 points on his birthday night and led the team to win against the Trail Blazers, and he had cool moves but just couldn't score. Poole, the ball's ice shooter, and Chris, who was abandoned by the Suns and rediscovered himself with the Warriors. In the 20-21 season, Curry returned and put in a superb personal performance. In the first half of the season, Poole was a fool and then asked to be transferred to the Development League. Other Warriors players are also giving people a brain hemorrhage (Zui Ge and Prince have not completely put down the thermos cup. Wiseman, Logoshit's Green, Wanamaker, Oubre, etc.) In the second half, Poole returned to the NBA and solved the biggest problem (not being able to score). He scored more than ten points in several consecutive games, which can be said to be given to Curry. Helped to a certain extent. In the 21-22 season, Poole was promoted to the starting lineup and started with Curry's brother Rooney to pursue his dream. He once reached the first position in the Western Conference. His average data per game also improved significantly. After Clay returned in the mid-term, Poole returned to the bench and played well. In the later period, Curry played well. After Lee was injured, Poole returned to the starting lineup and led the team to secure third place in the Western Conference for 20 consecutive games. This prevented the Warriors from losing home court advantage in the playoffs. Curry gave up the starting job to Poole in the first round of the playoffs. Poole also lived up to Curry. Playing his playoff masterpiece in three games also laid the foundation for his big contract. Throughout the playoffs, Poole provided the Warriors with good firepower. Before that punch, I felt that this young man who played with agility, had coquettish movements and had a funny expression had great potential. It is true that his mistakes throughout the season after that punch made people look like they had a brain hemorrhage, but don’t forget that Curry was injured twice because he and Klay helped the Warriors stabilize their record. Now that the Warriors and I are reunited, I still I am very optimistic about him and the Warriors in the new season. This is my answer, I hope it can answer your questions",,,,,7,63,502,7/1/23 9:10,,['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/006ElzN8ly1hfh0ozivswj30ed0ivta2.jpg'],,

The Lakers don't seem to want to be a team with limited space under the cap. Even if they sign someone from the market, they will probably sign a trade or use the full mid-level player. After calculating this, there are still six teams in the market that can afford a contract worth 30 million, including the Rockets, Spurs, Magic, Pacers, Pistons and Kings. We have already discussed the King in a separate chapter, so we won’t go into details here. The Hornets are close to this group, but they have made qualifying offers to PJ Washington and Xiaoqiao. If they stay on the team and the contracts of rookie players, the Hornets have limited potential to make big moves in the market. PJ Washington may be involved in a sign-and-trade operation. In this case, the Hornets will become a seller in the market. The Spurs and Pacers can return to the first category of teams. They have not yet completed the full coverage of young talents in all positions, but they have a clear core of team building, and they are not willing to languish for a long time to absorb talents, and are more willing to rationalize the lineup and play well.

The Spurs need a true center to help Wenban carry the cannon, and they also need to improve their immediate combat skills at the No. 1 position. The Pacers need to strengthen their forward line to solve the problem of the power forward acting like a center and the small forward acting like a shooting guard. The Rockets, Pistons and Magic can be roughly classified into the same category. The qualifier ""roughly"" is added because magic is slightly different from those two. The Magic know that their future forwards are Benqueiro and Wagner. This year they selected Anthony Blake and Jeter Howard. Together with the original three point guards in the backcourt, they have the capital to support themselves at positions 1 and 2. But at the 5th position, the Magic may be riding a donkey to find a horse. The Rockets and Pistons have basically determined the talent map for the five starting positions. Regardless of whether they can be played or not, at least for a period of time in the future, the Rockets' Amen Thompson, Jaylen Green, Whittemore, Smith, Shen Jing, and the Pistons' Corning Ham, Ivey, Osar Thompson, Duren, and Prince White are the key training lists of the two teams. The signing requirements of the Rockets, Pistons and Magic also have a common feature - they cannot introduce stars with excessive energy and destroy the existing young talent structure. What is needed is a supporting role puzzle veteran. Since the Rockets don't have the first round in their hands in 2024, they are eager to strengthen and have the most under-cap space. They are the most aggressive buyers in the market. They are the most dominant team in the league in the coming days. Compared with the Magic, the Pistons are more comfortable advancing and retreating (although the Pistons also gave away the first round in 2024, the 18th pick is safer). The Pistons will be more interested in puzzle pieces outside the 5 position, while the Magic will be more interested in puzzle pieces at the 5 position and wing shooters. The Rockets will be interested in all high-quality non-core free agents on the market, and their needs basically cover the needs of the Spurs, Pacers, Magic and Pistons. After the basic background is explained, let’s look at the free market. Let’s look at the backcourt first. Neither Irving nor Harden are likely to attract interest from teams with space under the cap. There is no need to talk about Irving, it is the best choice for him to keep the Mavericks. The Spurs may consider Harden cutting his salary to sign a short-term contract and sincerely leading the literary class. The Rockets have a similar mentality, but Harden himself may not be willing. Cutting salary (starting salary, number of years) to stay with the 76ers, or finding a suitable opportunity to cut salary and join a championship team is a more realistic option. VanVleet is a more complicated answer. On the one hand, his asking price is close to the core stars, and he will inevitably play a larger role as a point guard. This is not a characteristic that young teams like. But on the other hand, after all, VanVleet can play with or without the ball. As the third or even fourth point of the team, he has proven his compatibility and has rich experience in playing support. If he can reduce his salary or agree to sign a short-term contract, the Rockets and It's no surprise that the Spurs are interested in him. If a playoff team has the resources to sign and exchange and is desperate for a point guard, it can consider it, but it does not need to consider VanVleet, who is at the top salary level. Looking further down, the only reds in the backcourt are DiVincenzo, Bruce Brown and Clarkson. DiVincenzo, 26 years old, has three-pointers, defense, energy, ball handling, and a big heart. He does not occupy the ball and can do the dirty work. He is a ""little big brother"" who grows up beside the talent. Couldn't be more appropriate. There should be general interest in him. The question for him is, is he worth a contract above the full mid-level? This is very important, as it determines the chances of playoff teams such as the Lakers and Mavericks getting him. Brown's situation is similar to DiVincenzo's. He prefers an end-oriented style of play and has better flexibility in upward confrontation, but his three-point performance last season was slightly inferior to Devine. As a champion member with temperament bonus, Brown should be a puzzle signing commonly pursued by playoff teams. He and DiVincenzo have the same question. Can the full middle class be able to stop it? Clarkson, 31 years old, as a scorer who can stand up from the bench to solve the transitional offense, is actually more suitable for the playoff team than rebuilding the team. But if he is regarded as an asset that can be sold to a playoff team in the future with a profit, then whether it is the Jazz as the home team or a suitor with space like the Rockets, it makes sense to win him. However, Clarkson is not suitable for grabbing at a premium. After all, the prerequisite for resale in the future is a high-quality contract. After Eric Gordon was waived by the Clippers, there was another playoff guard on the market up for grabs. My pricing for Gordon is expected to be in the mid-to-mid range, a price point that will earn him league-wide competition. He won't be a priority target for teams in cap space. There are many well-known defenders on the market such as Seth Curry, Richardson, LeVert, Vincent, Thybulle, Reeves, Beverley, etc., but these people will basically not be put too much. High pursuit priority. Curry Jr., Richardson, and Beverley all don't need big contracts to sign. They at least have a certain value in the regular season, and they are pieces of the puzzle that can be picked out. The Cavaliers should not let LeVert go for nothing. Although LeVert is not their answer on the wing, the Cavaliers need a contract that can be used as a trade. Thybulle is a restricted free agent. No matter what the Blazers choose in the future, it is not appropriate to release him directly, so there is nothing to chase him. Reeves will be violently matched by the Lakers. Vincent and the Heat need a game of bravery, and the one who is more afraid of losing the other will lose miserably. Oh, and Westbrook. He is difficult to price, and there is no reason for young teams to pursue him. His strength is worthy of an offer above the mid-level level, but playoff teams will consider this double-edged sword when they are sure that the mid-level level is nowhere to be used. Staying with the Clippers wouldn't be a bad choice, and going to the Suns with a minimum salary would be a bit interesting, but the solution that can better prove Westbrook's value may be to go to the Nets and bring out a playoff team. However, my preferred plan is for the Wizards to sell a bunch of their stable point guards, then acquire Westbrook, and form the Avengers Big Three with Poole and Kuzma. Let's look at the frontcourt. Middleton is said to have renewed his contract with the Bucks. Vucevic completed a three-year, 60 million contract extension with the Bulls - let us wait for next year's trade deadline. A puzzle piece between the frontcourt and the backcourt, Josh Hart will most likely stay with the Knicks. There are very few big-name frontcourt players left. Dream Chaser Green. He went to dinner with Lillard, but it would be difficult for the Trail Blazers to become a real threat to the Warriors to renew their contract and pursue their dreams. To clear space, they need to give up multiple bird rights such as Grant, Thybulle, and Reddish, and they also have to bring Simmons or Simmons Nurkic gets some air. If we discuss a sign exchange with the Warriors, at least the Warriors can get some rewards from it. The direct threat to the Warriors is the team with space under the cap. But the Pistons and Magic wouldn't be interested in chasing dreams. Dream chasing may have some entangled temptations for the Rockets. They have the most real experience of the change that dream chasing has on the team's temperament, and this is what the Rockets need. But chasing dreams is a very risky move. He needs a specific form of game, and the Rockets are not sure they can provide it. If this signing fails, this will be a big opportunity cost. The Pacers need a good forward, but will Carlisle, who pursues space, like the dream-chasing style of play? How do the Spurs use Dream Chaser as the 5th position? Does his and Sohan's positioning conflict? Chasing Dreams will make some noise in the market, but the sincerity in the market may not surpass that of the Warriors. Grant, Kuzma, and Barnes will form the iron triangle of the free-agent power forward showcase, and I don't think they are suitable for the rebuilding young team. What's the point of a young team using a master of chaos like Kuzma? His most suitable outlet is to work with Poole to become a prospect with both statistics and traffic, or to become a strong-shooting frontcourt space point for some teams that do not have enough space - such as the Cavaliers, and the Cavaliers only have the full mid-level. Grant seems unwilling to play the role of wiping the butt of young people and becomes more and more like a ""corner"". He is suitable for signing a conscientious contract to stay with the team, or signing and trading to a playoff team to regain the feeling of puzzle. Barnes is the one that playoff teams want to upgrade for thousands of years, but he is expected to be cheaper and have clearer contributions, which makes him relatively suitable for young teams. Cameron Johnson and P.J. Washington are more suitable targets for young teams to pursue. As a top frontcourt shooter, Lao Huang Zhong is a scarce resource. He is a major improvement for a team eager to enter the playoffs, and the timeline is relatively suitable. PJ Washington is a popular swingman at the 4th and 5th positions. Although he has his own shortcomings in the 4th and 5th positions, when the salary is appropriate, he can be regarded as a medium-sized strategic resource. The problem is just that they are all restricted free agents, and there will be some cost to pursuing them—perhaps opportunity cost, or perhaps a sign-and-trade bargain. Perhaps the most popular player on the forward line is Grant Williams. He is 24 years old. In the past two seasons, whether in the regular season or the playoffs, his three-point shooting has withstood the test. He is physically strong and can carry Antetokounmpo and Embiid, and has a certain ability to switch defenses. Although the defensive guards are unreliable, unable to protect the basket when placed in the 5th position, and it is difficult to position inside as a forward, as a substitute frontcourt with shooting and top defense, there is no doubt about its strategic value. Whether it is a rebuilding team or a playoff team, they have the urge to pursue Gewei. Although the home team Celtic has also proposed the idea of Liu Gewei, their salary situation does not seem to support this. This means more like - even if they leave the team, it is best to make a sign and exchange to go back home. Use some resources back. Dillon Brooks is another potential market sensation. Half a year ago, you wouldn't have thought that Dillon might appear in the discussion of the full mid-level, but after consecutive disastrous playoff trips, people realized that Dillon's 20 million contract is a potential destructive force, and he must be a key A player who can be on the bench at all times, and even DNP in key games. Dillon's inability to hit shots, let alone control his desire to shoot, is the fundamental reason for his depreciation, but he is still an exciting lead defense option who can switch on any player. The playoff teams can compete for him with the full mid-level price, and several teams with space can get him at a higher price. Plumlee should be respected by the market. He is at least worth a mini-middle class. There is a high probability that Crowder will stay with the Bucks. Once he enters the market, he will only be worth the mini-middle class at most. The result of his low valuation is that the Bucks should have been able to keep him, which is why he has a high probability of staying on the team. Struss will become a player that no matter which team he signs with, he will be exciting. Playoff teams will wait for Gallinari to be waived and pick them up. They will also hope the same thing happens to Porter and Muscala. Once that happens, I don’t like any team that lacks frontcourt shooting resources. The team was exposed to sluggish reaction times. Powell, Landale, Eubanks, Lyles, Niang, Yuta Watanabe, these are all low-priced frontcourts worthy of attention - the Suns and 76ers may need to ensure that they have the money on hand before talking about reinforcements. resources are not lost. I won’t go into details here. As for Wood, I am reluctantly willing to pay a mini-middle class for him, but I am even more excited for Wood with a minimum salary. What about Hachimura? Will the Lakers blindly match his offer like they blindly matched Reeves? Compared to Reeves who has rules and restrictions, if you just hate the Lakers, you can do it by destroying Hachimura. Are there any important players we haven’t mentioned yet? There are two big ones. Big Lopez. The Bucks have 100% reason to renew his contract with him, but all teams with the ability to offer full mid-level and above prices also have 100% reason to pursue Lopez, which means that Lopez will receive a wide range of bids in the market. Considering Luo's 35-year-old age, 38-year-old clause, and the Bucks' tight salary situation, offering a premium short-term contract with a high starting salary should be the only way to pursue him. Playoff teams generally don't have this ability, and only a few young teams with cap space can do it. They have the demand and are not afraid of a premium - the Rockets should have no brains in this point. I also like the combination of Luo Luo + Wenban; Poeltl. He expressed his unwillingness to stay on the rebuilding team, and there is no certainty that the Raptors will continue to rebuild. Since the Raptors spent a lot of money to acquire Poeltl (the first-round protection given to the Spurs was the first six picks in 2024, which can be extended to 26 years), this painful protection pick and length of time make the Raptors' reconstruction choice difficult. (one of the reasons for the disease), even if Poeltl leaves the team, the Raptors will try to find a sign exchange. But if it's a team with room for naked signings, the Raptors can't control it. Poeltl's worth will be in the 20 million level, and he is the first choice for a team that lacks a starting big man - will it be beautiful to see him playing next to Wenbanyama? If Poeltl returns to the Spurs as a free agent, the rental fee offered by the Raptors will be ridiculous. Okay, we have introduced all the high-quality players on the free market. The market will open soon. Before July 1, this may be the last article that systematically analyzes market trends. This article obviously targets not only a few teams with cap space, but also the Lakers, Mavericks, and Timberwolves with full mid-level capabilities, the Nuggets with mini-middle capabilities, and the Warriors with only a basic salary. They can all find targets among them. But the situation of several teams with space under the cap is particularly important. They have the ability to send a total of 5 to 6 big contracts to the free market, leaving aside some stars (Irving, Harden) who are unlikely to go to such teams. They have the ability to harvest a large number of stars who are rare in the market and are above the middle-class level. Once Lopez, Poeltl, VanVleet, Grant, Barnes, Kuzma, Brees Brown, Dillon Brooks, and Di Vincenzo flow into these teams, let them have all the players in their hands. The middle-class buyers are embarrassed, so players who could only get mini-middle-class players have room for a premium. In other words, the ""Brotherhood under the Hat"" can raise the market level. If the market is disrupted, it's their fault. If the Cap fraternity doesn't end up running out of room, it could become interesting again where a few of the big premium contracts on the market end up. Tobias Harris, Hayward, Joe Harris, and even Thompson, three-way trades involving them will become easier. From this perspective, the Brotherhood under the Hat is also a good partner in the trading market. They will make large-scale transactions easier. For a team headed by the Rockets, how they spend their money will have a series of chain reactions - the Alphabet loses Luo Luo, Jokic loses Brown, the Celtics lose Gui Wei, the Warriors lose Dream Chaser, and the Lakers lose eight players. Village... The fraternity under the hat can make a long list of those currently licking and preparing to lick - just asking you, which team is the daddy right now.

4.92E+15,N7x7B8iG7,6598000284,Meat bomb tank-,"Let’s talk about some reinforcements for the Suns that I think are relatively suitable. With Wayliant and the Suns executing his team option, the Suns roster currently has a total of 8 players under contract, including Booker, Durant, and Bill Ayton. Goodwin, Isaiah, Todd Payne, Wainwright, are seven spots away from 15 players. Because the Suns will definitely exceed the second luxury tax line this season, because the new collective bargaining agreement stipulates that teams that exceed the second luxury tax line will not be able to send cash in the transaction, will not be able to send away the first round, and will not be able to get more from the transaction. Too much salary, unable to sign and buy out players, and unable to use the mini-middle class. Therefore, there are almost no serious ways to strengthen. The only one who has some chance to trade for reinforcement is Ayton, maybe Payne (will be mentioned later). I believe that normal Suns fans, unless you are teacher Yin Wenyu, will hate players like Ayton who are obviously suspected of negative games, and hope that he will get out of his home team immediately. But despite all the reluctance, Ayton also has a very good playoff resume. Now his trade value is at its lowest point. Fans hope that he can trade for some premium wings ➕ For an ordinary center, I feel that this is better than seeing this kind of performance. It is better to play passively and the perception of the game is shit. But we still need to think calmly, is this really feasible, and is this really the result everyone wants? For example, yesterday the famous reporter Marc Stein said that the Suns offered Hardaway, Holmes, and McGee chips in exchange for Ayton, but the Suns rejected it. I saw some Mavericks fans still gloating. I was quite shocked that Mavericks fans had no idea what the level of the players on their team was. Hardaway can only shoot three-pointers in one offense, and he is extremely unstable. Although defense is very difficult, Kidd often asks him to guard tall forwards, but the defensive effect can only be as good as his best. The key is that his contract will still be 18 million next year. Holmes couldn't even play in a team like the Kings, which didn't have a very good rotation. Since the start of the season, Brown couldn't stand it. In the end, he would rather train Ryan than use Holmes, with an annual salary of 12 million. Needless to say, McGee, in the 22nd season, under the curse of ""any center can get better"" in the Suns, he performed like a comeback. In the end, the hero used his familiar style to poach McGee with an annual salary of 6 million. As soon as he found out that McGee had joined the Lone Ranger, he immediately showed his poor skills, which also aroused the confusion of Xia Mi. But it is estimated that the most controversial thing is Bullock's discussion on the transaction rather than Holmes's transaction. I am not very decisive in my judgment, but the judgment of @Brian Inter Milan teacher is that this transaction is completely unnecessary. , Bullock is not a particularly good defender. His defensive flexibility is limited, otherwise Hardaway would not be able to defend tall forwards. He can only shoot three-pointers in offense. He has no two-point skills at all, and his three-pointers It's not that difficult to separate the shots, nor is it very stable. There was a painful first half of the season for Xia Mi. Compared with this, we should consider that the lineup after such a transaction will be Hardaway or Bullock starting ➕Center Randall (high probability will return to the Suns), compared with Okogie Ayton, I have Randall's size and level I don't have that kind of confidence. Of course, Randall is a player with better impact data than Ayton, but it does not mean that Randall is necessarily better than Ayton. Even in the playoffs, some teachers think that Randall should be used more, but although it is true that more players should be used. More time, but the problem of Randall's physical fitness is still obvious later on. Ayton has his value. Randall is not suitable to be a qualified starting center. Ayton will have more advantages in the regular season. So I probably think it's appropriate to keep Ayton. New coach Vogel has been saying in interviews that he will make Ayton better and believes that he has a good resume. As we all know, Vogel is a defensive head coach. I believe in his transformation capabilities and I think he can give Ayton such an opportunity. After all, Dunbao is really a treasure. If he sends away the coach he hates, he will inevitably get back on his feet. Due to the new collective bargaining agreement, we can only focus on the free market and be willing to invest with a minimum salary. The first is to keep the four players who I think are the strongest from the original lineup, namely Okogie, Craig, Biyombo and Landale. Except for Okogie, the other three have early bird rights, so the probability of keeping them will be high. Very big. Okogie is a bit difficult. He has performed well in the regular season and may be pursued by some teams. The remaining signing targets: 1. Yuta Watanabe (normal rotation): He should be the favorite little player of Durant fans. He worked with Durant in the Nets and played a season that saved his career. He is a promising player. A very standard-sized forward, he has a unique corner three-pointer and the ability to quickly advance and shoot three-pointers. Although his physical fitness is not top-notch, he has a very good assist defense IQ. Although there are shortcomings in single defense, He also has a very likeable energy, he has good ball handling skills, and his fast break follow-up always makes the fans excited. (While writing this, I have seen Marc Stein break the news that Yuta Watanabe is very interested in joining the Suns) 2. Win Snow (high-quality substitute): If you are not a friend who often follows the NBA, you probably don’t know who he is at all. He is a very magical player. Although he is 198cm and 100kg, when he played the fifth position of some lineups in the Trail Blazers, the effect was surprisingly good. His defense should not be underestimated. He can defend from one to five. Although his personal offensive finishing is poor in all aspects, he also has the card-dealing skills on the offensive end that are compatible with Bubidou. Signing him can be said in some specific situations. Might be very useful. The only shortcoming is health (only played 29 games this year), but I think he can be used as a lottery ticket. 3. Thaddeus Young (high-quality substitute): At his peak, Thaddeus Young has explosive physical fitness. He can play from behind and hook shots, and he also has the ability to handle the ball as a screener. As he gets older, his physical fitness is not as good as before, but he surprisingly played 58 games this year, hitting 80% in the 0-3 zone with a ratio of 38%, but it is estimated that there is a high probability that he is performing exceptionally. , he still has the ability to occasionally use his back hook shot, he is very experienced in defensively participating in double attack delays, he is also quite good in single defense and intercepting the ball holder, and he still retains good ball handling ability. 4. Kevin Love (high-quality substitute): He has just experienced a very good playoffs with the Heat compared to his current level, and is a hot commodity in the free market. His rebounding, size, shooting skills, and ball handling are all what the Suns need. 5. Eric Gordon (high-quality substitute): Because the Clippers suddenly cut his non-guaranteed contract to avoid taxes, Eric Gordon became a free agent. Although the Suns can only get a minimum salary and Gordon may get a larger contract, it is not ruled out that veterans like Gordon will be attracted by the Suns' multi-star lineup. Thinking that this will give them a greater chance of winning, the Suns still have The one who started it. A good wing ball-handler, although his ball-handling skills are not as good as before. He can now produce less, can shoot a lot of three-pointers, and can occasionally pass some good balls. He also has good individual defense performance. It is relatively extreme, the effect is relatively average, and it does not contribute to defense. The Suns using him to ensure the regular season is more reliable than re-signing Damian Lee and T-Rose. yy's trading targets: 1. Delon Wright (high-quality substitute): He is a defensive player who is underestimated by the public. His shot-breaking data is quite amazing. His influence on the court is excellent. Compared with the winning rate of the Wizards this year, The gap is quite obvious when he is a rogue. Although his shooting is extremely poor, he has a certain ability to hold the ball. His style of play is more stable than other defensive heroes (5.7 assists and 1.3 turnovers in 36 minutes). Because of this, his obpm0.4. The Suns can try to use Payne as the main body, although it seems that the balance is very difficult. 2. Gallinari (high-quality substitute): A veteran who suffered a serious ACL injury, he was a very high-quality shooter at the fourth position before the injury, and he has a very good With his position and skills, ACL's style of play should not be able to directly destroy his career. He relies more on his size and shooting skills. His defense is a problem. His steps are very slow. He cannot protect the frame or steal, but Because his offensive level does not affect him as a good player. Although I can't think of why Payne replaced him alone, and why the Wizards accepted it, maybe it can only be a good person who will do it to the end. After all, Bill is a good idol in their community. Disadvantages of the trade, overall the risk of injury is still high. This round of reinforcements all have one thing in common. They all have a certain ability to handle the ball. Either the offense has its own uniqueness, or the defense has its own unique skills. Based on the current situation, I think these are the most suitable for the Suns. Players who have a chance (except Wright). The main reason for handling the ball is to provide a guarantee for Ayton in the playoffs. There are many people handling the ball in the regular season, and the three cores without the ball can make it easier for these lame players to integrate. #Aiton, be tougher#",,,Brian Inter,"Ayton, be tougher",5,22,25,6/29/23 13:13,,,,

4.92E+15,N7pumgmFj,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"In the history of the NBA, among the few people with over 10,000 assists, the organizational styles of Kidd and LeBron are probably the most different. I won’t mention the similarities between the two, but they are just a few old words: wide vision, accurate passing, excellent rhythm, etc., which can also be used to praise other outstanding organizers. Both are masters at transitioning from defense to offense, and while LeBron may be the only one in history to talk about a combined threat from transitioning from defense to offense—individual offense and passing—Kidd may be the better organizer of transition from defense to offense: Running, pushing and counterattacking, he is almost close to the magician. The difference is mainly positional warfare. It also has something to do with their playing styles. Kidd is notoriously lackluster offensively. They say he has no basket, but in fact he has 1988 three-pointers, which ranks 15th in history in his career, more than Dirk, Redick, Durant, Chauncey, Kobe and Nash. ——Yes, Kidd has more three-pointers than Nash... But those who watch his ball will naturally know that most of Kidd's three-pointers are spot-up baskets, not to mention strong shots with the ball. What's terrible is not the three-pointers - 35% in his career - but his career two-point shooting percentage, which is only 40%: It's a credit to him that he shoots less. If he shoots more, his shooting percentage may be even lower. Needless to say, LeBron is on the other extreme: the all-time scoring leader and a historical basketball monster. Therefore, in the half-court offense and defense, LeBron's first choice in the early years was to go up to the line and hold the ball to find pick-and-rolls. After arriving in Miami, he crossed over to the weak side to catch the ball and then find his teammates in the air. After returning to the Cavaliers, he deployed a large number of space formations, so the top of the arc After starting, he can directly find teammates outside the three-point line or cut inside teammates. After arriving with the Lakers, because of his thick eyebrows, he starts at 45 degrees on one side and finds more teammates who cut inside and cross. But generally speaking, because of LeBron's breakthrough ability + vision + long pass, and the fact that he needs a space lineup to clear space for him, and needs teammates to cover him to start a breakthrough, LeBron's offense prioritizes breakthrough points at the top of the arc. Therefore, there are many shooters in his team, but most of them are fixed-point shooters. There are fewer stacking screens and air-cutting tactics like Korver, Ray Allen, Klay and Curry, and it is impossible to clear the inside and outside of one side. not too much. After all, the priority of the screen wall is to initiate a breakthrough for LeBron. The focus of the shooter is not to intersperse moves but to shoot the ball from LeBron. When he does not break through the basket but holds the ball at the top of the arc, attracting the opponent's defense to tilt, LeBron will first find the secondary ball handler who does not occupy the ball much, and start the receiving attack on the weak side - Wade, Irving, Rondo and even Reeves this season — to jump-start the offense. Of course, he can also directly use his incredible vision to directly transfer to the weak side: but more importantly, he can find his teammates in the corner after destroying the opponent's defense. A statistic: In NBA history, the season with the most corner three-point assists in a single season was LeBron in the 2016-17 season: 161. Among the top four seasons with the most corner three-point assists this century, LeBron has three, and the other belongs to Harden in the 2014-15 season; fifth is Nash in the 2004-05 season: his first MVP season. We all know: to assist with a three-pointer from the corner, you need a wide field of vision, and you need to have destroyed the opponent's defensive system and opened up the corner. This is LeBron's typical style: in positional battles, at the top of the arc, clearing, destroying, making large cross passes, looking for corner shooters, looking for long cuts inside, and looking for weak-side secondary offense. Where's Kidd? As mentioned above, Kidd lacks destructive power, so... 16% of LeBron's career assists are for corner three-pointers, and Harden's 13%: they are models of space basketball and destruction with the ball. Paul 10%, Rondo 9%. Nash was 8% -- but as high as 17% in his first season with the Suns. Kidd's career assist ratio of corner three-pointers to total assists: 5%. That is: Kidd basically cannot rely on dribbling to move or break through, forcing the opponent to leave the corner shooter open... but Kidd has other strengths. For single-season assists this century, Harden had the most in the 2016-17 season: 481. Nash accounted for three of the first six best seasons: we all know, Nash's pick-and-roll, Stoudemire's finishing. Passing the ball directly to the basket not only allows teammates to eat, but also tests the vision and reaction of quick hands and eyes. For example, Jokic's assists at the basket account for nearly 50% of the total assists. This season, he has 678 assists, 358 of which are directed to the basket: so everyone thinks that Jokic's passing is incredible. In the 2001-02 season, Kidd provided 443 assists to the basket, fifth in this century. He does not have a feeding partner similar to Stoudemire to Nash. He does not have the flexibility of dribbling like Nash/Paul, nor the amazing breakthrough and destructive power of LeBron and Wade. It all depends on the quickness of hands and eyes in a moment. Therefore, Kidd is very good at finding his teammates under the basket instantly from sideline balls or chaos. If you have paid attention to Kidd's positioning in positional battles, you will find that he likes the extension of the free throw line very much, which is about a 60-degree angle. In that position, he can choose to pass the ball to a teammate on the strong side (Kenyon Martin/Vince Carter/Dirk Nowitzki in isolation), or he can choose to pass to a teammate on the weak side (League of Science). Chad Jefferson/Vince Carter/Jason Terry) make the ball. Compared to LeBron and Nash, who prefer to open and close at the top of the arc, Kidd likes to do things on one side: his offensive power is not enough to disrupt the opponent's formation, so he relies on the opponent's defense to make mistakes: taking advantage of the strong side threat of his teammates, see Aim for the opponent's weak side to make a mistake and give the ball. In the 2010-11 season, Kidd averaged 8.2 assists and 2.2 turnovers per game, which was very low. However, Coach Carlisle claimed that the most important data for a point guard is not assists, but wins; he also said that Kidd is the team's leader. Pan people. Just watch the game in Dallas and you will know: That season, Kidd rarely got the ball in positional battles and was the coach on the court. At first glance, he looked like a 3D player. When the strong side gets the ball, it basically means looking for Dirk to play, or arrange for Terry/Barea to cut out on the weak side; on the weak side, it basically waits to catch the ball and shoot into the open space, or to catch the ball and pass the ball directly. Therefore, Kidd's positional battle command, from his positioning to his playing style, is more like a stager who allocates resources. Compared to LeBron, Nash, and Harden, he lacks the ability to create offense out of thin air. Of course, this involves a hidden advantage of Kidd: Compared with the common problem of the new generation of ball handlers - Trae Young and Luka - Kidd is quite non-sticky to the ball - probably because he sticks to the ball. The ball can't break out of the gap anyway... So... From 1996 to 2001, Kidd's Suns ranked among the top six in the league in assists every year, including first place three times. When Kidd left the Suns in 2001, the Suns immediately ranked eleventh in the league in assists. The Nets, who ranked 26th in the league in assists the previous season, ranked third in the league in assists in Kidd's first season. After that, it was also three, four, five and six all year round. Kidd left the net in 2008 and the next season: ranked 26th in the league in net assists. The next season, he ranked 30th in assists. Kidd not only has high assists for himself, but also for his team, the entire team has high assists. He can't attack, but he is willing to pass and transfer a lot so that his teammates can pass the ball easily. Therefore, Kenyon Martin and Van Horn all played at the peak of their careers and even reached the finals with him, Carter and Jefferson played their career masterpieces with him, and Dirk can win championships with him. Even when he went to the Knicks, Melo won the only scoring title in his career. Carter's career-high assist data was played next to Kidd. So: You throw a spacing lineup at Kidd and he can't reach the top like Nash, Harden or LeBron. But if you have a team with a good internal and external configuration, he can pinch it for you: relying on the top counterattack in history and simple but effective ball movement in positional warfare. He doesn't have to have the ball, or even stand at the point guard position: When Dallas won the championship in 2011, he was a non-stick 3D with on-court command attributes, shooting three-pointers, defending hard, and setting up the plate to let Dirk let go of the offense. , by the way, only 8.2 assists per game. #kid#",,,,Kidd,23,181,600,6/28/23 17:47,Weibo web version,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hfe2vccbpdg30eg085npf.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hfe2vdjj5bg30eg085x6r.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 005ztwqOgy1hfe2vembmeg30eg085hdv.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hfe2vipdotg308o05wb2a.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hfe2vjaovag308o04wn pd.jpg']",,

Warriors guard Donte DiVincenzo declined to exercise his player option for next season and became an unrestricted free agent. This news immediately triggered a battle between teams, especially the Rockets and Lakers, who were considered to be DiVincenzo's biggest suitors. Donte DiVincenzo signed a two-year, $9.23 million contract with the Warriors last offseason, which includes a player option for the 2023-24 season. According to previous reports, once DiVincenzo becomes a free agent, the Warriors may not be able to afford the asking price of a new contract, and his market value is expected to be at least a mid-level exception contract. Now DiVincenzo refuses to exercise his player option, which means the Warriors can no longer sign him back. During the regular season this season, DiVincenzo's performance with the Warriors was remarkable. Averaged 26.3 minutes per game, he contributed 9.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, assists and 1.3 steals. Although his playing time was reduced in the playoffs, he was still able to contribute 5.5 points, 3.0 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 0.8 steals to the team. The comprehensive statistics throughout the season have made DiVincenzo one of the targets of the Rockets and Lakers. The Rockets and Lakers respectively expressed strong interest in DiVincenzo. For the Rockets, they do not pay special attention to players in specific positions or specific skills, but hope to get a veteran who can help the team win. They need to find players who match the core lineup, are experienced and can play a role on both ends of the court, and DiVincenzo has exactly these characteristics. As for the Lakers, DiVincenzo can be a shooter and ball handler on the bench, depending on the situation of the Lakers' current players and how much they pursue DiVincenzo. However, DiVincenzo hopes to get a big contract, and the Lakers may not be able to afford such a contract. As a versatile defender, DiVincenzo has aroused fierce competition among teams with his comprehensive skills and outstanding performance.

4.92E+15,N7e6rrYBK,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Sending Collins away, the Hawks at least have a clearer direction] The Hawks sent John Collins to the Jazz, and only got back Rudy Gay and 1 second round - almost pure clearing space. Just a little compensation? Yes, that's it. But this is not unusual news. If Collins was really easy to sell, the Eagles would not have been on the market for so many years. The Hawks have these contracts: Trae Young for 40.1 million; John Collins for 25.03 million; Capela for 21.1 million; Bogdan for 18.7 million; Murray for 18.2 million; Hunter for 20.1 million; 810 Wan's Okongwu; and a number of scattered small contracts. With a bunch of tens of millions of contracts but no five-star general - Wu Cao, how did the Eagle secretly become a lone ranger? Don't be fooled, the Mavericks' Jigsaw puzzle with a multi-million contract before was still not as good as others. After all... After all, the Eagles are all in the 20 million level. If nothing is done, the Hawks' salary bill next season should be stuck at the hard salary cap. In the summer of 2024, the contracts of Murray, Okongwu, and Sadiq Bay will expire, and all of them will have to have their salaries increased. By then, the Hawks will be able to It has become ""rich before it gets strong"", and the strength in the bottom half of the playoffs has to face the second-hardest salary cap. Therefore, let's not talk about reinforcements. The first theme of the Hawks this summer is to solve the billing problem. The method without any second thought is to move Collins, who has the second highest salary and whom the team wants to send away every year. Collins is a good player, with strong finishes, the ability to punish mismatches with the ball, good physical confrontation, and the ability to undertake some special forward matchup tasks, such as defending Butler in the play-offs. His problem is that he can't find a suitable position: the job of ending the pie should normally be given priority to the center. Capela and Okongwu take it, but Collins doesn't; what about holding the ball? Is holding the ball something you can ask at your level? The ball is in the hands of Yang Zi and Dejounte Murray. The improved Hunter will also have to play some ball-handling. When it comes to Collins, all that is left is to stand in the spot; standing in the spot is more important than three-pointers. The newcomer Sadiq Bay, the three-pointer is much better than Collins. When Sadiq Bey played the fourth position, the Hawks' offensive efficiency was 131.1, and they beat their opponents by 16.5 points per 100 possessions. Collins's two numbers were 116.1 and 0.1 respectively. The gap is obvious in a small sample. Take Collins away, and the Hawks have a superb pick-and-roll in the backcourt, the center dunks hard, and the forward space is wider. Snyder said it is right. There is nothing wrong with putting Collins anywhere. This is of course not a matter of a day or two, otherwise the Hawks would not have planned to sell him long ago. In the past, if you were dissatisfied with the transaction returns, you could put it off for a while, but now that the salary bill is in your face, there is no need to put it off. Collins' contract lasts until 26 years, which is difficult to deal with. No playoff team that needs Collins' immediate strength can help clear space for the Hawks - unless it's the Kings we mentioned yesterday, but the Kings will think, ""Minibus, why don't we start over."" It would be good to find help from those rebuilding teams with space, and they don't care if you want draft picks. To be honest, the Hawks were able to get a second round pick in the end, which is pretty good. After sending off Collins, the Hawks still have sufficient forward personnel. In addition to Hunter and Saddiq Bay, there are also Jaylen Johnson, the 20th pick in 2021, and AJ Griffin, the 16th pick in 2022. In fact, the Hawks have backups behind their core rotation. Behind Capela is Okongwu, and behind Collins and Hunter are Bay, Johnson and Griffin. Previously, Yang, Murray, and Bogdan still had a backup relationship with each other. Now they have selected defender Bavkin with the 15th pick. It can be said that the new generation is forcing the old one. The core rotation of the team is not old, and there are younger backup tires behind them. Should I say that the Eagles are full of talents, or... or that the resources are too scattered and lack traces of integration? The Hawks picked up three more rookies in the draft. In addition to point guard Bafkin, they also had second-round pick Mohamed Guyer and second-round pick wing shooter Seth Lundy. Young has just matured from people's rookie impression, and there are already 9 rookies after 2020 behind him. While lamenting that the Hawks can really accumulate draft picks, I can't help but ask, is it time to change the change? This is a strange question. After all, the Hawks just introduced Murray last year and they are a team that has played small stud. However, this deal was not optimistic at the time - the Hawks believed that there were too few players other than Young who could handle the ball, so they brought in another ball-holding point guard who was lower than Young but must start in the backcourt. , this kind of resource allocation idea is obviously very crude and weird. Looking back, it seems that the Hawks have already gone through the team building process. Hunter has already received a big contract, and his inconsistent positioning may be the next target to be dealt with. Huerter has become an important puzzle piece for the Kings, and Reddish has already found his third destination. Since the Hawks have always attached great importance to the supplement of draft picks, even if the Hawks eliminate some answers in the process of building the team around Yang, they are constantly being supplemented with new resources. In terms of ""quantity"", the Eagles have always been good. They have never had anyone available in the lineup. However, it's not appropriate to ""love one when you meet one"", and it's not appropriate for each of them to be unable to draw their full life. In terms of chemistry and star quality, do the Hawks pass the test? This is obviously a problem that the Eagles cannot avoid. The Hawks have already made some adjustments, and sending Collins away can be seen as the third step in the Hawks' chemical adjustment process - the first two steps are hiring coach Snyder and introducing Ceddique Bey. Coach Snyder has brought a higher level of coaching, and the improvements in this area are already visible to the naked eye. In the first round of this year's playoffs, the Eagles' excellent pertinence and execution were impressive. Bay is a necessary addition to the Hawks' new system, which makes their configuration characteristics closer to Snyder's version of the Utah Jazz. OK, can a Hawks team similar to the Jazz - pick-and-roll in the backcourt, open up the space for the forwards, eat the cake inside, a standard pick-and-roll team - be successful? At least the direction is clearer. As for the topic of the limitations of the playoffs, what the Hawks want to discuss is not even the issue of lineup matching, but whether their core, Yang, has reached that level - haven't the Hawks themselves wavered in their determination to build a team around Yang? The first thing the Hawks must work hard to do is try to be as close to the story of reaching the conference finals in 2021, and at least become a team with a good record in a large sample before the highest stage, instead of being stuck in the play-offs and struggling. They temporarily got rid of the salary crisis after sending Collins away, but they still have abundant resources, and the boss also stated that they can pay the luxury tax if necessary. The team is now in a situation where it can advance or retreat: the Collins trade received a 25.3 million transaction exception, which can be used without it (to save money), or it can get a key puzzle piece - does Bojan want to continue playing for Snyder? He only has a fully guaranteed contract for one season, which does not affect future plans; Murray, Hunter, Capela, Bogdan, no Hawks boss is absolutely safe. If a suitable big-name star leaves, will the Hawks get involved? They have young people, and they haven't completely squeezed out the draft picks. Maybe they can ask about the price of Towns and George; or maybe the Hawks just continue to complete their metabolism, let Okongwu gradually replace Capela, and the front line is overhauled, hoping that Buff King made an early contribution, so two years later, the Hawks replaced another group of people, and the finances were under control. In terms of record, the playoffs against Miami continued to become the highest honor of the season? When they reached the Eastern Conference Finals in 2021, the high-spirited Hawks seemed to have an unlimited future. Looking at the Hawks today, they still have unlimited possibilities. But even a young team can't rest on the possibilities forever. The Hawks did not see enough returns from the risk of Murray's trade, but they still saw considerable progress in changing coaches and updating the operation of the 4th position. Sending Collins away is a continuation of this direction and is in line with their financial management. Finally, a few words about Jazz. Playoff teams won't be willing to pay valuable chips for Collins, and they won't be able to clear space for the Hawks. A young rebuilding team won't need Collins. Only a team like the Jazz that ""stands and rebuilds"" would take Collins back for fun. What? Collins is awkwardly positioned and difficult to use? That's what you said about Markkanen before, and the Jazz turned him into an all-around warrior. It's difficult to predict the impact of acquiring Collins on the Jazz's subsequent market operations. Getting an insider may mean that the probability of Olynyk leaving the team increases, but you will also like the look of Collins + Olynyk behind Markkanen + Kessler. The continuity of the inside line is full. The Jazz's first round in 2024 was in the hands of the Thunder, and the top 10 picks were protected. With the Jazz's lineup and insincere attitude, it was not a small probability event that the Thunder would end up with the last pick in the lottery. Therefore, it is best for the Jazz not to make operations that are too harmful to immediate combat effectiveness and not to think about protecting draft picks.

4.92E+15,N76y9C5qy,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[From the King’s intention to pursue their dreams, to the frontcourt reinforcement situation] In the 1st draft, the Kings used the 24th pick to send Holmes to the Mavericks. Prior to this, the Mavericks had just dropped the No. 10 pick by two picks, sending Bertans to the Thunder. After that, they still got the player they planned to select, center Lively, and then used the Kings' No. 24 pick. Prosper was hired to make up for the loss of Finney Smith. After this wave of operations, the Mavericks can still use the full mid-level exception. They all gave away unused contracts. The Mavericks got a first-round pick + a try-out center for nothing, while the Kings lost a first-rounder. For a team that doesn't need to worry about the luxury tax for the time being, , they obviously have a purpose in paying such a price. The Kings can now clear more space. If they give up the Bird rights of Barnes and a few scattered pieces, the Kings can ask for the price of 30 million free agents on the market. The Kings can't offer a maximum salary, but that doesn't matter. The Kings wouldn't pursue Irving, and there's no need to bid for Harden or VanVleet. Their target is the forward line. Considering the price of forwards in this year's free market, the Kings can afford to sign almost anyone compared to other teams with cap space on the market-unless the Lakers also clear space and go this route. ——The Kings are the only playoff team. For those stars who still have ambitions and are not just looking for a big contract, the evolved Kings are not a bad place to go. The Kings were extremely decisive in sending away Holmes with the No. 24 pick, which seemed to imply that the Kings had a clearer goal. Considering the technical characteristics of another starter on the front line - Keegan Murray, a tall shooter who lacks matchup value - the Kings may need a power forward with matchup size, and this person's level obviously should not be low. At Barnes. The following three targets are suspects: Dream Green, Jerami Grant, and Kuzma. In a vacuum, these are 3 good players. But you can easily find ways in which the three of them are unsuitable for a king. How does Chasing Dreams get along with Xiao Sa? Sasha's improvement in the King's level is largely due to his frequent offensive participation in pivots, and Dream Chaser must be in this role to have a sense of existence. Neither of them can open up space for each other on the off-ball end. When encountering the master of basket protection, you can imagine in advance the scene of them throwing the blame to each other in the paint area. Although Barnes' offense is unreliable in the playoffs, he is also a space point who can squat on the three-point line. The Kings can try to maintain space continuity at positions 1 to 4, and they have the first offensive efficiency in the regular season. It is of considerable significance. In terms of compatibility, placing Dream Chasing at position 4 is undoubtedly a setback, and it will not make them better. In addition, compared to the Warriors, it is more difficult for the Kings to determine their compatibility with the Dream Chasers. To get the Dream Chasers, the Kings will almost have to offer a 4-year fully guaranteed contract (a 3-year contract cannot compete with the Warriors). Once such a contract is Once signed, it is difficult to resell. The risk is not worth taking for the king. The question for Grant and Kuzma is, are they really better than Barnes and do they need to spend a first round in advance to clear space? Almost all of Barnes' home teams will dislike him by the end. He lacks a defensive presence and cannot hit three-pointers in important games. Grant and Kuzma are more famous and can handle greater production, but how meaningful will this be to the Kings, whose main starting method is to cooperate with the center in the backcourt? At least in terms of aggressiveness in punishing mismatches, Barnes is no worse than Kuzma and Grant. Grant also failed to prove his ability to contain the ball without the ball in the playoffs, and Kuzma's three-pointer is impressive more because he dares to shoot. He has a twitchy game, but his crosshair is not his strong point. Barnes is still a powerful opponent, but Kuzma's defensive flexibility is not as good as Barnes. Grant may have been a better help defender in his early years. This season, Barnes, Grant, and Kuzma averaged 2.8, 2.8, and 3.1 basket protections per game respectively, which can be said to be a sudden rise. So, it's not the three of them? That's not necessarily the case. The Kings each have a reason, which makes it reasonable for them to sign Dream Chaser or Grant/Kuzma: the rationality of signing Dream Chaser-if the Kings want to give up the hip-slim Sasha in the playoffs. They have a plan to take down Dream Green and Lopez at the same time. If you don't want to give Sasha to the Warriors or Bucks in the process, it's not difficult to make a separate three-way deal to clear up space. This process can also earn you a fortune in draft picks. This plan will make the Kings instantly become a top defensive team, and ensure the conservation of space inside. They will have the opportunity to compete with the top teams in the Western Conference in the next 1 to 2 years. But the king will also age quickly as a result. This move is too eccentric and can be described as a ""demon"" approach. Reasonableness of signing Grant/Kuzma - younger, better subjective feeling. Barnes is 31 years old, Grant is 29, and Kuzma is 27. You definitely want younger players to get a four-year contract. And just the general concept that ""Grant/Kuzma are better than Barnes"" is enough for the management to make a not-so-valuable change. 2. In the free agent market, there are other targets that the Kings may consider: Middleton. This possibility is not high, but if the Kings want to substantially improve the offensive level of the forward with the ball, this person is the only choice for the forward line in this summer's free market; Cameron Johnson. His level is worth the trouble for the Kings, but while the Kings will fill up the forward space, they will also lose the flexibility of forward matchups, and Huang Zhong’s status as a restricted free agent will make it difficult for the Kings to succeed, unless they have already cooperated with Cai Tsai. The boss said hello and compensated the Nets with draft picks. Further down the salary scale, although they will be included in the Kings' consideration list, it is difficult to understand the significance of the Kings going to war for them, including: Grant Williams. A heavy 3D forward who has proven three-point reliability and special matchup value in the playoffs. If you need someone to guard Antetokounmpo while not harming the space environment at positions 4/5, you can sign Gewei. But his expected price shouldn't be too much higher than the full mid-level; PJ-Washington. Can be swung as a jack-of-all-trades/loose power forward in the small ball interior. He is a restricted free agent and needs the Hornets' nod, which may involve sign-and-trade compensation; Bruce Brown. Everyone is familiar with the small wing versatile player. His problem is that he is too small and cannot even be called a forward; Josh Hart. An energy wing, great striker-level matchup value, excellent defense and rebounding, a nose for the ball, a very good puzzle piece. not cheap. There are indications that he will not leave the Knicks. These guys are all good, but none of them seem worth pursuing with 1 first-round clearing space up front. We can also broaden our horizons and focus on non-free agents. As long as the Kings fill in 1 to 2 more contracts and match their draft picks (27 first rounds, 29 first rounds, 9 second rounds), except for George, Sika and Randle are doubtful (the upper and lower limits of value are erratic) ), the Kings have the ability to eat raw or close to raw almost all forwards who may leave the team, including OG Anunoby, John Collins, Tobias Harris, Bojan, Finney Smith + Royce O'Neal package. The question is, if the Kings are targeting players under contract, why hasn't the trade happened yet? As for Kyle Anderson, whose contract is at the next level, or Gallinari, Porter and others who have lottery contracts, they have nothing to do with clearing space. I think the Kings are 100% chasing Anunoby. This big 3D forward who can guard 5 positions is almost perfect for the Kings, but this kind of trade does not need to wait for the free agent market to open on July 1st. Compared with the trade exception , the Raptors would be more willing to take an extra first-rounder, and the Kings would not need to use the draft pick to send Holmes away first. However, if the Kings plan to use Barnes in a sign-and-trade deal, they will indeed have to wait until after July 1 to make a move. Another way for the Kings to guarantee the bottom line is to maintain their status as a cap-rated team and renew the contracts of Barnes and Lyles. Then, they also have the full mid-level salary (12.4 million), as well as the players they received from the Holmes trade. The transaction exception (12 million) is used for reinforcement. This would give them an advantage when bidding for power and Bruce Brown. In addition, there are two pieces of news recently: First, the Kings have offered Vezinkov a contract, and the annual salary is expected to be a little less than 8.4 million. The Kings purchased the rights to Vezinkov from the Cavaliers last year. This is a point of spending money; secondly, the Kings may re-sign a contract with Savoy, and only teams under the salary cap are allowed to re-sign. The reason for this is that Savoy's salary next season is only 22 million. Even according to the new version of the labor agreement, the starting salary for early renewal is allowed to be 140% of the last year of the original contract. Sacho's new contract will only be 30.8 million, which means , the Kings were originally unable to complete an early contract extension with Savoy this summer, leading to the risk of losing him next summer. Re-signing the contract can give Sasha a big increase in salary next season, thereby completing an early contract extension. In other words, the King made a lot of troubles, perhaps to retain Sasha in advance. All in all, the Kings are indeed the playoff team most capable of paying high prices for forwards on the market. Many frontcourt players will be on the Kings' sniper menu, but Dream Chaser should not be their number one target. They have nothing to do with Dream Chaser. The rumors are more like a means used by Chai Meng to raise prices. 3After we learned about the King's situation, basically all the high-quality forwards on the market have shown their faces. So, is there a team that can help us sort out the center situation on the market? Fortunately, we can still start with the king. Unless they break up with Savoy, the Kings don't need a starting-level center. But the Kings do need a backup center, and Lunn and Metu can be used, which doesn't seem like the best answer. If the Kings end up taking the team's route to increase caps, their full mid-level salary (12.4 million) and trade exception (12 million) can be used to reinforce the forward and the backup center. On the market at this price point and below are: Plumlee. If the Clippers don't plan to rebuild, or turn George, who is in his contract year, into an All-Star center - would you like Westbrook + Kazi + Towns, Huazi + George + Goubey - they will try to keep Oyster like this. A center who is mobile, can handle the ball, and can finish. Compared to Zubac, Oyster looks more suitable for the playoffs against a team that is a ball-handling and shooting team. His style suits the Kings. For other teams on the market, Plumlee is a player who has more than enough substitutes but not enough starters. His price should be between the mini-middle class and the full mid-class; Naz Reid. He has already agreed on his next contract with the Timberwolves, for three years and 42 million. There is no point in the market considering him anymore. But his contract has reference significance - the starting salary is 13 million, slightly higher than the full middle-class salary. With Reid's contract as a guide price, centers waiting for asking prices in the market should respect themselves; Wood. He may think highly of himself, but Wood's difficult-to-position defense determines that he is more suitable as a substitute center, so he should not get a contract above the mid-level. Brown won't like his selfish style of play and defense. Further down are some lower-priced centers that may flow into the market. Which one they take depends on fate. If you can get Powell, Love, Eubanks, and Landale at a low price, it would be a no-brainer to pick them up. The base salaries of Harrell and Thomas Bryant can be scratched. If there is no suitable candidate, it is feasible for the king to keep his own Lunn and Meitu. There are several centers on the trading market priced below 12 million: Gafford. 12.4 million, which is just beyond the reach of the King's special transaction. The point of mentioning him is that even if only technical characteristics are considered, he should not be on the Kings' menu. As a high-quality terminator with defensive limitations, Gafford cannot provide enough differentiation from Holmes. Functionally, if the Kings reinforce in this direction, it would be inconsistent with them sending away Holmes; Olynyk. 12.195 million, which is just a few dollars short of the transaction exception. His offensive style is a perfect fit for the Kings system, but he can't provide the rim protection that Sasha can't. He is more suitable for teams looking for teams with a different style from the black and thick inside, and what the Kings need more is to improve the hardness of the 5th position; Portis. 11.71 million. If the Bucks find a cheaper backup center solution - although I have a hard time imagining what that solution is - Portis may be pursueable after re-signing Middleton and Luo. If so, Portis is a suitable candidate for the Kings to take over with a trade exception. He can be 4 or 5 and solve two problems at the same time; Claxton. 8.75 million. If the Nets find a more suitable starting center solution, the fourth brother is not unable to enter the market. He is at a high point in value. As a backup center and small-ball inside man, the fourth brother at this price is very good, but there will be some risks in renewing his contract; Zubac. 10.93 million. If the Clippers rebuild, it would be a no-brainer to take Zubac and Hartenstein. 8.2 million. Able to support, finish, and rebound, he can be described as a lower-position substitute for Savoy on the bench. His defense is even better than Sacho, making him a perfect fit for the Kings. It's a pity that the Knicks basically won't touch him. When lower-priced Muscala and Zhuangshen enter the market, they can be introduced at a low cost. The Kings have many options. They can become a team under the cap and introduce a big-name striker. They can re-sign Savoy to ensure that he stays on the team. They can continue to retain the current lineup as a team above the cap or sign and swap. They can rely on full mid-level and trade. Special cases reinforce the puzzle, and it makes sense no matter which way you go. Okay, so far, in addition to a few superstar forwards and a few of the best centers on the market, we have basically listed all the potential high-quality forwards and centers in the free market and the trade market - are we just making a reinforcement plan for the Kings? ? No, we just chose the perspective of the Kings, a playoff team that can play both off and on, and has a certain amount of chips. They have many options to choose from, allowing us to take the opportunity to see more possibilities. In the next few days, we will also look at the market operation from other perspectives such as other teams with cap space (Rockets, Spurs, etc.), playoff teams, etc., and will take a final look at the potential market conditions before July 1.

He often uses tricks such as pretending to be a pig to eat the tiger, making a big move, and having a head-to-tail battle to upset the opponent. Please stay tuned, Lao Yang will definitely have something to tell! Today we will continue to talk about the three games. Please like, follow and support Lao Yang. League: Norwegian Super League Time: 06-25 23:00 Team: Molde VS Haugesund Age: 31 years old, 32 years old, 20 years old Suggestion: Win first and let’s talk about the first Norwegian Super League game, Molde vs. Haugesund Er, Haugel has been working hard to avoid relegation this year. This team usually plays a relatively conservative style, but in these two rounds of league games against relegation opponents Stremgas and Sandefjord, they attacked and succeeded. After defeating the opponent, the weight of relegation has increased a lot. After two consecutive fierce battles, the players' physical strength is not very good now. Molde is strong on the offensive end. They rank third in goals scored in the Norwegian Super League. Breivik, Grodem and Bussen Hildsson are all in the top ten scorers. I think the pattern of this game should be Not too small. League: Norwegian Super League Time: 06-2601:15 Team: Strom VS Bode Shine Age: 02 years old, 13 years old, 12 years old Recommendation: Lose Next is the duel between Stromgas and Bodo Grint, St. Tomgas is a relegation team. They use iron barrels in the game. Bodo Grint is the strongest offensive team in the Norwegian Super League. The two centers Pellegrino and Pemi are both in the top five scorers. Not only can the two score goals, but they also cooperate with each other very well. This game should be able to break the home team's iron barrel formation. League: European Youth Championship Time: 06-2602:45 Team: Norway 21 VS France 21 Age: 02 years old, 13 years old, 12 years old Recommendation: Lose The last is the U21 European Youth Championship, Norway vs. France, France has many monsters in the midfield and frontcourt, go up In the first round, they still played proactively against Italy, which had a strong defense. The French defense lacked several main defenders. Center back Badét also received a red card in the last game, and the defense was a bit unstable. Norway's style of play is completely that of the adult team. There is no problem with the cooperation of the players, but there is a lack of individual players. Once it falls into a positional battle, the situation cannot be opened. We are fans of France in this game. NBA game updates are in the video and top workbook. Since the time is earlier, the changing data may affect the results. Friends, please refer to it carefully. The scene is more stable.

But his 6-foot-8 body has relatively rare handling skills. In addition to shooting, he is also good at finishing at the basket. The main reason why he withdrew from the draft until this year was because his athletic talent was too poor and his three-point shooting dropped. But from a comprehensive perspective, Mayer is very good. He also has quick hands on the defensive end. He is good at stealing and mainly plays an anticipatory role. I really like this Taobao.

These things may mean nothing until they show concrete results. But because of this background, I have a lot of confidence in his future growth prospects. As for Whitemore, I have doubts about his health report, because no one has questioned his health throughout the season. There are no more solid reports on either the heart or the knee. The tibia injury is What happened during his freshman year of high school and the player's injuries are very unlikely to be hidden in today's Internet world. It was suddenly revealed that he had health problems. The fact that he had health problems is questionable in itself. But no matter how the 20th pick is taken, the risks that should be avoided are avoided. With this kind of talent, there are no flaws at all. Another thing the radio station forgot to mention is that the Rockets' newly signed Summer League contract player, Matthew Mayer, had been eyeing him when Baylor won the championship two years ago. At that time, the main focus was on shooting range. But he dropped out two years in a row. I have to leave the university campus this year. The shooter's aura has almost faded. This year he only shot 33% from three-point range, making him a very productive and inefficient shooter. However, he is a 6-foot-8 striker with a handling ability that is inconsistent with his size. He can hold the ball and hit the basket and is quite efficient. His main problem is mediocre base talent. Coupled with the fading of the shooter's aura, losing the draft may have been a long time coming, but Mayer is a very versatile player, very good at predicting on the defensive end, good at stealing, good at assisting defense, and obviously relies on IQ to play, although the dynamics are not Excellent, but he has an excellent size and is a good glue player. I will regard him as a perfect candidate for a two-way player. He is older than most of the players on the team.

4.92E+15,N6LsBmrvk,2279435255,The Seventh Young Master of Hua Mansion,"When Lively's workout in Dallas ended, Mavericks scouts and analysts left the court smiling. One of them lamented: It's incredible that he never gets tired. Lively also impressed Mavericks executives after the workout, sitting down with them and recounting his ordeal in detail. Lively's father, Dereck Lively Sr., struggled with heroin and cocaine addiction and died of a drug overdose in 2011, when Lively Jr. was just 7 years old. His mother, former Penn State basketball star Kathy Drysdale, was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma nine years ago. This shows his character, he is a strong person who has to deal with a lot at a young age and deal with it in a professional manner. In the interview setting, he talked about never blaming anyone for his misfortune growing up, that misfortune made him grow, and he embraced it to make himself stronger and able to take care of his mother. This moved me very much. —Finley Harrison says defense, not offense, will help Lively and Prosper earn playing time in their rookie seasons: It would be great if Lively could pull out and hit some three-pointers, But he'll be cutting inside to the basket for at least a few years. ESPN's Kevin Pelton: I like the two trades the Mavericks made, trading the 10th pick and Bertans for two first-round picks and Holmes. Liveley looks like a good value and a good fit, but I don't trust Prosper as much. He has almost no assist or block production at the NCAA level, and he ranks 60th in my projections. Tim Reynolds of the Associated Press: Dallas got its big man and traded away Bertans, and it's hard to say it wasn't a good night. Now the free market awaits them. Prosper is a player with huge potential who showed off a tough defense at Marquette. S Yahoo's Krysten Peek: Lively is the best rim protector in this class outside of Benyama. His pre-draft workouts showed a significantly improved three-point ability. The rhythm and speed of the NBA are consistent with his skills. His most direct impact is that he is a 7-foot-2 big man. A Charles Curtis of USA Today: Acquiring two rookies like this while also handling Bertans' contract deserves an A-grade rating. A. CBS's Colin Ward-Henninger: The Mavericks succeeded in both areas, getting rid of Bertans' contract while acquiring two potential rookies. Liveley has Tyson Chandler-like running and shot-blocking abilities, and Prosper was promoted because of his athleticism, size and defensive versatility. While solving two needs, Mavericks also saved money. Kyle Irving of A Sports News: The Mavericks will definitely win the 2023 draft. Switching to the 12th pick also freed Bertans' contract and got the Lively he wanted. He will be a defensive anchor, and playing next to Luka will make him a much bigger lob threat. Prosper, the latter first-round pick, is a dynamic, versatile wing who has shown potential as an outside shooter and would be another perfect partner next to Luka.

I found that among some of the great players in the NBA, in addition to having good athletic talent, they are also very stable at their core. For example, when Jordan faced Mutombo's ""eyes-closed free throw"" challenge with a free throw, his mentality was not affected, but he was very confident and made the ball steadily with his eyes closed. Another example is when Kobe faced Barnes' ""serve challenge"". Barnes dangled the ball in front of Kobe's eyes and even touched Kobe's eyelashes, but Kobe didn't even blink. Usually those ""people with a stable inner core"" are the same in daily life or work. They will not be affected by people or things outside. Their hearts are very stable and powerful, full of hope for the future, and have clear goals in life. Life is like a battlefield, and competition is the norm.

Interested in learning more about the history of Inter Miami? Franchise player? others? Stay and read this article, which tells you the most relevant content: 🇺🇲 Let’s start with the basics: it is one of the leagues with the most teams in the world [29] and is divided into two conferences, East and West , yes, just like the NBA. Teams participate in 34 regular-season games (traveling with teams in their region) and inter-district games, and are selected by lottery. 🏆How is a champion defined? After the regular season, the play-offs begin. The top seven teams in the standings qualify for the play-offs, and the play-off winners between eighth and ninth place qualify for the play-offs. This rematch or ""wild card game"" is not defined in a traditional way, like the quarter-finals, as both situations are defined as a ""best of three"", meaning whoever wins both games wins. qualified. In the semi-finals and finals, the format is a single match and the best ranked team is the local team. After winning each division, they will face off against each other in December to define the ""Super Champions"" 💸Salary Cap | Franchise Players: MLS rosters can be made up of up to 30 players (there is no requirement to fill all slots). For the 2023 season, each team's salary cap is $5.2 million + a variable of $1.9 million. Players coming through a club's youth ranks can earn up to $125,000 more than the minimum annual salary for reserve players [$67,000] or senior players [$85,444]. A football player's salary cannot exceed $651,250, and in order to produce an operation like Messi's, Major League Soccer provides each team with three players over this number, so-called ""franchise players."" For example, Leo will far exceed these numbers as he will receive approximately $50 million per year. 🗓️Major League Soccer has a rather peculiar calendar: - Regular phase: between February and October. -Also in October: the ""Wild Card Competition"" takes place and the play-off quarter-finals begin (ends in November). - Semifinals: end of November. -Final: early December. ✅Draft: Another similarity to the NBA is the famous draft: it consists of a list of football players selected by the teams, and the entire process is divided into three rounds, with each team having one selection opportunity. The closest team always has the first pick, and from there they pick in order determined by the team's performance last season. The champion chooses LAST, which is a rising standard. [Choose the worst first]. 🔎Extra MLS facts: -The number of foreign players in the league cannot exceed 233, but the quotas are not necessarily equally distributed, and the quotas can be determined by negotiation between each organization. -The Eastern Conference has an odd number of teams, with 15 spots, one more than the Western Conference's 14 spots. -Rivalry Week: As the name suggests, it's basically a classic battle. -The league awards the MLS Supporters' Shield, an award given to the team that scores the most points in the regular season between the two leagues. Inter Miami data: -Officially established on January 28, 2018. -Making his MLS debut in the 2020 season. -Never made it past the regular season. -His all-time top scorer?

At the end of the fourth quarter, the Thunder had already secured the victory. The Jazz replaced the starter and ""thrown in the towel"". At that time, I was ready to close the game. The live broadcast is off. Then, Burks, who came off the bench, scored 10 points in 2 minutes, single-handedly preventing OK3 from leaving the field. This was my first impression of Burks, when he was 26 years old; as he grew older, his ability and desire to break through and attack the frame gradually declined, but he has been making steady contributions to many teams and is perfectly qualified for the position of a wing shooter. In the first eight years before entering the industry, he averaged 9+3+2 per game and 35% of three-pointers; in the past four years, he averaged 14+4+3 per game and 40% of three-pointers. He is an extremely strong pitcher! This year Burks is having a career year. 7.7 three-point shots in 36 minutes with a 41.4% hit rate, an absolute top shooter. He has a beautiful catching and shooting rhythm and hand shape, and his shooting confidence is superstar-level. He cannot leave the ball open at all (55% of wide-open three-pointers). Although he only started 8 games, his offensive influence was amazing. The Pistons scored 8.8 more points per 100 possessions, EFG increased by 3.8%, and turnover rate decreased by 2.8%, all of which exceeded at least 95% of the league's players. Burks ranks first on the team in four advanced statistics: EPM, LEBRON, RAPTOR, and BPM this season. As a guy who takes 90% of his shots from three when he plays basketball, I dream of having Burks' jump shot.

4.92E+15,N6xmaxAq0,2279435255,The Seventh Young Master of Hua Mansion,"The Mavericks' drafts in the past 20 years are basically clear. Josh Howard was the 29th pick in the first round of 2003, Marquis Daniels was picked up as an undrafted pick, and Devin Harris was the 5th pick in the first round of 2004. Later, he used the first rotation from 2005 to the 21st pick in the first round of 2004, and selected Bode Kolkin. During this period, he was a strong contender for the championship and had a strong lineup. Therefore, the draft mainly focused on imaginary opponents and lineup depth. For example, the joint trial confirmed that Germany Ving Harris had the potential to be ""Parker's nemesis"" and he was decisively selected. He advanced the future first round in a Nuggets style, striking while the iron was hot, but he was blind and chose a rough-hewn Bod Colkin who later became ill. . After returning from defeat in the 2006 Finals, during this period, due to the successful completion of Josh Howard's succession to Finlay, I hope to continue to complete the lineup update. I selected Agger with the 28th pick in the first round of 2006, hoping that he will gradually succeed Sta. Khaus became the team's sixth man. Of course, Agger failed to do it, but this year he found a little man named Barea after losing the draft. The final achievement was enough to make up for Agger's regret. In 2007, because the first round was given to the Warriors in Dampier's trade in 2004, we worked very hard in the second round to supplement the team's strength. As a result, Fizekas, the 34th pick in the second round, was lost. The one behind him was ""Big Baby"" Glen Davis, Rayshawn Terry drafted with the 44th overall pick, and Sebutis drafted with the 50th pick didn't even make it into the league. They had three second-round picks, but they still couldn't make it in the league. This year, one of the ""big treasures"" or Gasol was found in the second round. He was sent away in the Kidd trade in the first round of 2008, and shooter Shan Foster was selected with the 51st pick in the second round. Pre-draft analyst Jay Bilas said his shooting range could not reach the NBA's three-point line. Cuban finished the draft. He tried to protect his kid but he choked back, but during the summer league, he discovered that this guy was really only good at shooting from the three-point line in college. The three-point line in the NBA is basically short. In 2009, Nelson Jr. showed his ability to trade down picks for the first time in the draft. The 22nd pick in the first round eventually became the 25th pick in the first round + the 56th pick in the second round and a 10-year pick. Round, the one selected with the 25th pick in the first round is called Beaubois. The first round of 2010 was also sent to the Nets in Kidd's trade, but the team was not discouraged and spent US$3 million to buy the 25th pick in the first round and selected Dominic Jones. The period from 2006 to 2010 can basically be regarded as the second stage. In this stage, due to the aging of the team's lineup (especially the replacement of Devin Harris with Kidd), Dirk also has to go three times, so the draft operation obviously hopes to be effective. Newcomers gradually took over and cherished the draft picks, but they had bad vision and luck. During this period, the only success was the undrafted Barea, Beaubois was at the peak of his career, and Dominic Jones was tepid and ended up being the one the team needed most. When he stood up, he was shocked and eventually became a CBA star. The first and second rounds in 2011 were all traded for Rudy Fernandez... In 2012, Nelson reappeared his ability to tinker with downward transactions. This time, it was a first-round rotation to a first-round + 2 second-rounds: the 12th pick in the first round The position was changed to the 24th pick and the 33rd and 34th picks in the second round. Regarding the situation of the first round in 2012, I did a review on Weibo in 2013 (the Nokia N8 was still used at that time). To put it simply, it means upward. The attempt to trade Rivers Jr. and Kendall Marshall failed. Tyler Zeller was selected with the 17th pick and then traded down to get Fournier with the 24th pick. As a result, Fournier was intercepted and the team hurriedly selected the player before the draft. Cunningham's market has suddenly risen in the past few days. Both Nelson and Carlisle are very optimistic about him, saying that he is a playmaker. It is obvious that they are looking for such a rookie this year, but it is a pity that Cunningham is blind. Cunningham is also a player with the most glorious career. Players whose footprints remain in the CBA include Bernard James with the 33rd pick in the second round, Crowder with the 34th pick, and Draymond Green with the 35th pick. This year was actually a bit of a trade in order to add new blood. If I like Fournier, the 17th pick is completely available, but I chose to trade down in order to get two more second rounds. In 2013, it was also the day before the draft. Ma Hong was still blasting the Mavericks and preparing various plans. O web link, O web link. In the end, despite his intention to pursue Howard, he still resolutely selected Larkin with the 18th overall pick in the first round. Then he used a 14-year rotation to select Ricky Ledo with the 43rd pick in the second round. In the first and second rounds of 2014, he was sent to the Lakers and Knicks in the trades of Odom and Chandler respectively. In 2015, Justin Anderson was selected with the 21st overall pick in the first round, and Singer was selected with the 52nd overall pick in the second round. In the undrafted draft, Major was picked up. Rondo was traded away in the first round of 2016. With the 46th pick in the second round, Nelson Jr. selected a center named AJ Hammons based on Finley's recommendation. The years 11-15 can be said to be turbulent. After winning the championship, Nelson Jr. had great luck in player transactions. The team worked hard to select players who can help the team in the draft. This was especially obvious in 2013. Public opinion generally believed that Nelson Jr. Even though the Mavericks gave up the first-round pick in pursuit of Howard, they still chose to stay and select at least one point guard that the team was most lacking at the time. They even used a second-round pick to add another guard. The team worked very hard. He hoped that Dirk would remain competitive in his later years, but it didn't work out as expected. In 2017, the team selected DSJ with the ninth pick in the first round. The related story is that Mike Fisher revealed that the Mavericks rejected Russell's offer from the Lakers for the ninth pick, and Mahon revealed that the Mavericks traded Matthews +9 for Rubio +7. His offer was rejected by the Timberwolves. At that time, it was reported that the player the Mavericks wanted most was either DSJ or Ntilikina. It was not until many years later that Walgaris bizarrely revealed that the player Carlisle wanted most was the 13th overall pick Donovan. Mitchell. There is no need for popular science in the 2018 draft. 2017 and 2018 are obviously different stages from the previous ones, because the team began to intend to keep the signing and even took the first round to select ""cornerstone"" players to complete the historic task of succeeding Dirk, and then the ball The team has Luka. Going back to this year's draft, which is about to begin, I have repeatedly said that the situation this year is very similar to that of 2013. Before the draft, the media revealed that the Mavericks had various plans. Judging from the Mavericks' usual operating habits, the Mavericks should still be inclined to see whether their favorite target will fall to the tenth pick (for example, if Whittemore or Hendricks falls) before making a decision. After all, now What they are looking for is a ""new fan"" and both Fan and Dort are undrafted. As long as the Mavericks have confidence in their vision, it would be a normal decision to switch down and get another player with immediate combat potential.",,,,,3,4,16,6/22/23 23:58,mavschina super talk,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hf7f4bgtqlj20u016wqcb.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hf7fuhfo1uj20u0190gre.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 87dd6bf7gy1hf7fu4co3ij20sg0ixt9w.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hf7fup56r5j20u0182th1.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hf7fu5f8cfj20s g0jvtbt.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg. cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hf7fu5f2xpj20sg0izdil.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hf7fun15x2j211m0u0ah1.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hf7fu589r bj20sg0ig76w.jpg', 'https:// wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7gy1hf7fu5jizbj20xc0m8adv.jpg']",,

4.92E+15,N6mN90h5I,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Lakers Guards Special] Today is a special session related to Lakers guards. 1. The two Raptors guards that the Lakers should pay attention to: VanVleet & Trent Jr. Trent Jr. announced that he has exercised his 18.8 million player option. This is somewhat unexpected news. Isn't Trent Jr. not confident about getting a salary higher than this number in the free market? Maybe it is possible, after all, he is not leading on any track. If you are looking for a defender who can play the main offense, you will definitely not consider him. If you're looking for a multi-purpose puzzle, you'll want to consider the Bruce Brown. If you're looking for a tough defender, consider Dillon. If you're looking for a small body 3D, the DiVincenzo will be cheaper. Considering that the Raptors' future is uncertain and they really can't find a buyer on the market, it would be a bit embarrassing if the home team doesn't take over. However, there are many teams with room under the cap this year, and there is an obvious demand for the shooter-type No. 2 position. The probability of Trent Jr. finding a new home after jumping out is not high. Continuing to play for another year and leaving the suspense until next summer may not be safe for a player of his level. One possibility is that after exercising the player option, there will be an extension or extension of the contract waiting for him. Moreover, he can also be included in the trade, and many teams can match the 18.8 million contract. It's hard not to think of the Lakers first. Theoretically, the Lakers have the ability to acquire Trent Jr. from the free market, but the Lakers will suffer additional losses as a team under the cap. Unless they have a truly worthy star, they should not do this. If Trent Jr. can be acquired through a trade at a small cost, it will be more cost-effective than becoming a team under the cap. Trent Jr. has been a prolific shooter in recent years. In the past three seasons, his catch-and-shoot three-point shooting rate has reached 40.7%, and he also has a certain ability to hold the ball and shoot from mid-range. His defense is relatively reliable, which is a big upgrade compared to Beasley who can't play in the playoffs. But compared to Trent Jr., the Lakers may be more willing to consider VanVleet first. VanVleet exercised his $22.8 million player option. When he first signed his contract, I was worried about the risk of a premium. After all, VanVleet’s potential to be developed was exhausted, and his style of play was highly dependent on shooting efficiency. Once there was a fluctuation in his hand, it could be catastrophic. season. The reality is that VanVleet's stability is better than expected, and he is fully worthy of his worth in the first three years of this four-year, 85 million contract. So, what then? VanVleet is pursuing a contract extension with a starting salary of more than 30 million. We assume that the market will give him a starting salary of 30 million instead of 30 million. A rising tide lifts all boats. The salary cap for the 23-24 season reached 136 million. The starting salary of 30 million accounted for 22% of the salary cap. VanVleet’s salary for the 20-21 season (the starting salary of the previous contract) accounted for the proportion of the salary cap at that time. is 19.5%. The proportion of his salary increase is not as exaggerated as the absolute value seems. Of course, you can still say he's not worth the price. The last playoff game VanVleet participated in was in 2022. He was unable to score or defend. His retirement due to injury was the key to the Raptors' two-game victory over the 76ers. But VanVleet was suffering from injuries after all. He had highlights in the Finals. He was a reliable off-ball player in a large sample, had qualified offensive ability at the 1st position, and had good defensive toughness and matchup flexibility. . Compared with Russell, he is obviously more compatible with the Lakers. Compared with Harden, VanVleet's biggest advantage is that he will be at least 5 million cheaper. If we were to draft a ball-handling leader in the backcourt, I would be willing to shell out the extra 5 million for Harden—assuming the extra 5 million was enough—but if we were just looking for the team’s 3rd or 4th point, and I hope he can take on some leading defense tasks, then Van Fleet has his own uniqueness. The most important thing is that being 5 million cheaper will make it easier for the Lakers to balance the signing and exchange, and there is also a chance that it will not affect Hachimura's contract extension. However, choosing VanVleet will inevitably make the Lakers unable to use the full mid-level, and it is impossible to have VanVleet and Russell at the same time - although there is no need. 2. The Lakers' own two guards: Reeves & Russell. The Lakers' strategy for dealing with Reeves is relatively simple: just match the market price without thinking. The Arenas clause has severely limited Reeves' starting salary next season, and the Lakers have no reason to give up a Reeves who will receive a full mid-level salary in the 23-24 season. Furthermore, considering that the Lakers will be relatively loose after two seasons With the salary environment, even if the next team offers a contract structure that will skyrocket in the 25-26 season, the Lakers have nothing to worry about. Since Reeves' contract renewal will inevitably trigger the BYC clause, it will be technically difficult to balance him in the sign-and-swap transaction. Unless the next buyer is not Reeves, the Lakers have no reason to use Reeves when there are multiple contracts that can cooperate with the operation. Put it into the deal. The Lakers' main focus is Russell. Russell has never proven that he can produce a reliable offensive performance in the playoffs. This year's true shooting percentage of 51.6% is even his new playoff high. He is also not a qualified defender and cannot take on any difficult defensive tasks. The first thing the Lakers can think of is, of course, to regard Russell as a trading chip that can be used for sign and exchange. Most teams on the market will not take the initiative to be interested in Russell, but in some special circumstances, this opportunity exists: first, if other teams have players who want to leave and have to go to Los Angeles, in order to avoid Losing assets in vain, they are willing to do a sign-and-trade with the Lakers to get compensation, which allows Russell to once again play the role of a general equivalent in the league - for example, the aforementioned VanVleet; the second one, feelings - Basketball Will the Nets accept Russell's return? Russell + the No. 17 pick as the main body, replacing Finney Smith and Royce O'Neal, wouldn't the Lakers take off? The idea is good, but the Nets will have to deal with the hard salary cap problem. With the No. 21 and No. 22 picks in hand, the Nets' interest in the No. 17 pick is a question mark. Since the sign swap can only occur after the free market opens and the draft has passed, the Nets cannot combine the three first-round picks and trade them up. But if Russell accepts a contract that is far lower than expected and the Nets fail to pursue Lillard, they might not consider it. There is also a possibility that Russell, as a free agent, will simply run away without giving the Lakers any chance. For example, the Spurs or Rockets, after all options to upgrade point guards failed, directly dumped Russell for a windfall - this is unlikely. If the Lakers fail to find a suitable option to sign Russell in the end, they need to make the following trade-offs: Re-signing Russell will prevent the Lakers from using the entire mid-level team. Of course, if the Lakers can really lower Russell's starting salary to 20 million or less, the situation will be different. Holding a contract of this size, combined with this year's rookies, can become a bargaining chip in future transactions; the full mid-level The meaning is that you can go to the market to find strikers and interior reinforcements. Although this year's free market has very limited mid-level forwards and interior lines, if you have such a special case, as a qualified team with the goal of competing for the championship, you should still do the following two things routinely: Offer Grant William Ms. Although the Pacers will easily offer a price higher than the full mid-level price, and Gewei's psychological expectations will also be higher than this price, but what if? Quote Bruce Brown. There is nothing to say, weakening your opponent is strengthening yourself. In addition, if Xiao Ma is cold in the market, you can also try to take him home with a full middle income. However, the possibility of this is almost zero. After all, adding a little bit of price and keeping it for your own use, then brushing up on the data before making a move, is the Wizards' favorite trade. 3. The Lakers’ ultimate dream: LaVine & DeRozan. What is LaVine’s market price? Bill next door bought him for a bargain price. The two were close in ability and both had impressive career periods. The comparison of other conditions is as follows: Bill is 29.9 years old and LaVine is 28.2 years old; Bill's salary for the 23-24 season is 46.7 million and LaVine is 40.1 million. Both contracts expire in the summer of 2027 and both have player options; both have 15% The transaction is guaranteed, but Bill still has the right to veto the transaction, LaVine does not. LaVine's contract will be better than Bill's, and the asking price will naturally be higher. But the Bulls will encounter a ruinous situation after a ""nuclear war"". After various winning teams are striving to win, how many teams can come up with rich bargaining chips to pursue LaVine? Most of the draft picks have gone to several rebuilding teams, and these teams will not be interested in LaVine. If the Heat successfully steal Lillard, the Bulls' expected next destinations are the Kings and Knicks. They have needs and chips. Boss Cai is another hidden powerful buyer in the market. After all, Simmons + Harris will make money if they exchange anything. After that, there are a few brothers who are intentional every day and whose pockets are cleaner than their faces. Although the chips are not as good as those before, the Lakers still have the opportunity to inquire about LaVine's price. But compared to the pursuit of difficulty, the price required to obtain LaVine will be more daunting. The Lakers at least need to regularize the contract of one of Bamba and Beasley, give Russell a contract, and then have the basic conditions to balance LaVine. After that, the Lakers' salary will go straight to the second-hardest salary cap. In the 24-25 season, the five of them, James, LaVine, Reeves, and Hachimura alone may earn 165 million in salary. From another perspective, it is not a bad idea to gather a core lineup before the new version of the collective bargaining agreement is gradually implemented, without strengthening it all the way to the end. You should also like the aforementioned Lakers core five's compatibility with and without the ball. In terms of providing off-ball firepower, LaVine is better than all the discussions in this article. But now that DeRozan is available, would he be a better fit? DeRozan is a stronger attacker, and his presence will raise the opponent's pressure against the Lakers to another level. The Lakers have also proven that their overall ball intelligence and mid-range ability can be used in a lineup with multiple ball handlers. Maximize tolerance for three-point disadvantage. None of these are as important as this one - DeRozan only needs 28.6 million next season. In theory, Russell + the No. 17 pick will have a chance to balance. It is difficult to predict the specific chips, and DeRozan will be very popular. Pursuing him is obviously a short-term operation, and you may not be willing to use him until the first round in the future. In this case, the bargaining chip the Lakers can offer is the No. 17 pick + Russell + several second rounds, and this There are many teams that can use this level of chips. If the trade happens at the trade deadline and DeRozan really wants to go to the Lakers, the hope will be even greater. So, what about Owen? Let's put it this way: Irving can basically provide all the on-field advantages mentioned above; but Irving also has all the operational difficulties mentioned above. Irving's departure from the Nets has nothing to do with money. It is unrealistic to expect him to take a significant salary cut. Signing and replacing him will take a lot of effort. This has added great salary pressure to the Lakers' future, and he is not young enough to find him. It is also looking for short-term results. Irving may be the perfect answer to the Lakers on a competitive basketball level, but on a basketball operations (and non-basketball factors) level, he is undoubtedly the worst answer.

This news has been confirmed by the Bucks Notified Warriors management, but has yet to receive a response. According to the trade plan, the Bucks will give Khris Middleton, Julius Junior, Brook Lopez, two first-round picks and two second-round picks. This is a huge deal aimed at improving the Bucks' strength and creating a more comprehensive lineup for the team. The Bucks management stated that if the Warriors are not satisfied with the deal chips, they are willing to negotiate, and said that in addition to the team's core Antetokounmpo, other players can also participate in the transaction. This shows that the Bucks hope to use this deal to consolidate their competitive position in the Eastern Conference and further enhance the team's championship competitiveness. This news caused quite a stir in NBA circles. Stephen Curry is one of the most influential three-point shooters in NBA history. His arrival will bring a lot of threats to the Bucks' offensive end. Andrew Wiggins is an excellent shooting guard, and his excellent shooting and defensive abilities will further enhance the Bucks' overall strength. Trump is a young player with great potential, and his arrival will inject new energy and future development space into the Bucks. However, there are some unknowns and challenges with this agreement. First, it remains to be seen whether Warriors management is satisfied with the trade chips provided by the Bucks. The Warriors must evaluate the long-term benefits of this deal before deciding whether to accept it. Secondly, the Bucks may need to further adjust their trading chips to suit the needs of the Warriors, which will require more in-depth negotiations between the two parties. Regardless, the possibility of this trade has sparked buzz and predictions from fans. If the deal goes through, the Bucks will build a strong team and become one of the favorites to win the Eastern Conference championship, competing fiercely with opponents such as the Nets and Celtics.",,,,"sports, NBA",0,0,0,6/21/23 7:30,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/6cb4d36dly1hf3czr47gcj20hs0br3yy.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/6cb4d36dly1hf3czr7jvgj20nz0c8ta9.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/ 6cb4d36dly1hf3czr4ct3j20h80a70tg.jpg']",,
4.91E+15,N6hqj1hDj,5192149203,Sachiko Sakura,"#体育##NBA# After Curry entered the NBA in 2009, he was isolated by the team boss without playing a single game. The reason was not only that Ellis did not want the team to select the point guard, but also that Curry and Curry A temperament that doesn’t fit in with the team’s atmosphere. At that time, Golden State still had the gangster spirit of the Golden State Gang, and many players on the team were very repulsive to Curry, who came from a wealthy family. Even Warriors Saint Jackson once said in an interview that Curry said that some people are born with a silver spoon in their mouth. , but I lost my mother when I was a child, so maybe we are not the same person. In order to ease the relationship with his teammates, he deliberately controlled the number of shots and did his job conscientiously. On October 26, 2009, Curry learned that it was the birthday of the boss Ellis. After training, Curry volunteered to find the coach and said that he was good at singing and asked him to sing happy birthday to his boss. So a scene like this appeared, where an exaggerated and off-key birthday song came from the mouth of an immature primary school student. The originally pleasant birthday song turned into a devilish sound. Alice held the cake and looked at Curry in disbelief. He never expected that the rookie who was rejected by him would take the initiative to celebrate his birthday. Although he took the initiative to show his kindness to his teammates, Curry was still the target of bullying by the whole team at this time. , but Curry is using his own way to gain recognition from his teammates bit by bit, but after all, basketball is still a sport that uses the ball to speak. Only when you perform on the court will others look up to you. In the first month of Curry's rookie season, his performance was decent, averaging 9.8 points, 5.5 assists and 1.3 steals per game. As Ellis suffered more and more injuries, Curry gradually gained more and more possession of the ball. The sharpshooter who shined in the NCAA was finally able to show his true strength. On January 23, 2010, in the Warriors' game against the Nets, when Ellis was not feeling well, the baby-faced boy stepped up and made 11 of 21 shots, scoring 32 points and 7 assists, and led the team to defeat the Nets. . Ellis never imagined that this little rookie contained so much energy. In the game between the Warriors and the Clippers on February 10, 2010, Curry broke out again, scoring 36 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists, getting his first career triple-double. The powerful offensive power shown by the rookie Curry made the players defending him Unexpectedly, the final schedule then deepened, Ellis was out of action many times due to injuries, and Curry got more opportunities to perform. Before this, people had never thought that there was such a player who could change the game with three-point shooting. At the end of the season, the Warriors achieved a record of 26 wins and 56 losses, but Golden State fans were full of hope because Curry, a rising star in the league, was about to set sail. In the offseason of 2010, new boss Lacob took charge of the Warriors. After the slogan that brought the Warriors to the ranks of the best sports clubs in the United States, the Warriors fired head coach Nelson this season and promoted assistant coach Smart to serve as interim agent. As the head coach, they also introduced All-Star big man David Lee, and selected Udo and Jeremy Lin in the draft. The Warriors' changes are obvious, and their goal is to break into the playoffs. However, because Smart prefers to use Ellis, Curry's playing time has been compressed. At the same time, the atmosphere within the Warriors is also very tense. In November 2010, a female Warriors employee sued Ellis for sexually harassing her over a three-month period. As soon as this news came out, it caused intense discussion among the outside world. In this case, the Warriors management made a decision that could change NBA history. In the 2011-12 season, Curry was plagued by injuries. More importantly, these injuries occurred without confrontation. Curry fell into a cycle of injury, recovery, and comeback. He only played one game throughout the season. After 26 games, he was even called a glass ankle by the outside world. Rumors of trading Curry have always been heard, but after examining Curry's injury, the Warriors management determined that there was no structural damage. They chose to offer Curry the famous child labor contract in the future, worth 44 million for four years. Ellis has exploded this season, averaging 24.3 points and 5.6 assists per game. The incompatibility of the two's playing styles, coupled with Curry's injury, has made the Warriors consider trading Curry. So before the deadline of the trading day, the Warriors reached a deal with the Bucks. The original target of the deal was Curry, but unexpectedly, the Bucks did not choose Curry because of his injury risks. Instead, he chose Ellis, who was in hot form, so Curry was forced to stay in Golden State. After Ellis left the team, Curry completely became the absolute core of the team. After Ellis was traded, the Warriors and Bucks met again, and Curry hugged Ellis in greeting. Many years later, Curry picked up the microphone again and again at Oracle Arena to build momentum for the home court and speak for himself, but he will definitely remember that when he was a rookie, he also used the microphone to sing for team boss Ellis. That birthday song. At Ellis' wedding, he only invited two NBA stars, and Curry was one of them. In the last game of the regular season at Oracle Arena, the entire Warriors team wore jerseys from the Golden State Gang era. Before the game, Curry put on the No. 8 jersey of former boss Monta Ellis and walked into the arena easily. , although the combination of the two did not bring victory to Golden State, it brought more hope. At that time, people would not have thought that Curry, who had been plagued by injuries, could grow to such an extent, and no one would have thought that Thompson, Ellis's younger brother, who served as a substitute for Ellis that year, would create with Curry what kind of legacy belongs to the Warriors. era.",,,,"sports, NBA",0,0,0,6/21/23 7:25,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/laarge/6cb4d36dly1hf3cw2ir4uj20Hs0amq3i.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/6cb4d36cw2jb5ij20H20H20H20H20H20H20H20H 20H s0b3aao.jpg ',' https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 6cb4d36dly1hf3cw2kcb6j20hs09pwff.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/6cb4d36dly1hf3cw2j4jej20hs08njs5.jpg']",,

This is the second game of the national football team in four days. Previously, the national football team had defeated the underdog Myanmar 4-0, ending an 18-month, nine-match winless streak. In this game against Palestine, which is also a weak team, I believe the national football team will strive for a big victory. #体育vplus开户# As a result of defeating Myanmar, the national football team gained 2.41 technical points, while Guinea and Honduras lost at the same time. Therefore, the national football team will climb 2 places in the latest FIFA rankings to be announced, from 81st to 81st. 79, but still ranks 11th in Asia. It is reported that there is a clear gap between the national football team and Uzbekistan, which is ranked 10th in Asia. Considering that the opponent has just won the Central Asian Cup, it is very difficult to overtake and it will be difficult to surpass in the short term. However, facing Palestine, the national football team still has the task of winning, because defeating the opponent can gain another 4.39 technical points, while a draw will lose 0.61 points. If they lose, they will suffer heavy losses and directly lose 5.61 points. If the national football team is a second-rate team in Asia, then Palestine is a third-rate team, currently only ranked 93rd in the world. Data shows that the national football team has played against Palestine 5 times before, with 3 wins and 2 draws remaining unbeaten. From 2006 to the present, the national football team has never tasted defeat in Palestine. But what is somewhat surprising is that the national football team's maximum score against Palestine is only 3-1, and the goal difference is only 2 goals at most. The gap is not big. Especially in the last two meetings, the score was 0-0 in 2014 and 1-1 in 2018. They have failed to win from each other in two consecutive games. Facing Myanmar in the last game, Jankovic finally won his first win since taking office, ending an 18-month winless streak of 9 consecutive games in all competitions. For the national football team, the next task is very simple, that is to strive for a winning streak, or even a big victory over Palestine, which will not only improve morale but also continue to earn points. After scoring twice against Myanmar, Wu Lei's number of goals for the national team increased to 29, surpassing Yang Xu and Marin, rising to second in team history, and only one goal behind Liu Haiguang, the first in team history. . #vplus Football Carnival Season# As long as Wu Lei scores a goal in this game, he will at least be tied for the top scorer in team history. If he can score twice or even score a hat-trick, he will exclusively occupy the top spot in team history. . Of course, considering Wu Lei's age and attendance efficiency, the difference in this goal is nothing. There is almost no suspense in surpassing Liu Haiguang. It is just a matter of time, but can the overtake be completed tomorrow? We'll see. In addition to Wu Lei, Lin Liangming is also worth looking forward to. The Dalian forward just scored his first goal for the national team in the last game and was very active. He is expected to continue his hot form. #PictureRecommendation#NBA",,,,"Sports vplus classes have started, vplus football carnival season, picture recommendations",0,1,1,6/20/23 18:24,NBA Super Talk,['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/008xrRzVgy1hf4uzqg165j30zg1baq95.jpg'],,

4.91E+15,N658nAtO6,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"The Washington Wizards traded Bradley Beal and received Chris Paul, Shamet and a bunch of second-round picks from the Phoenix Suns. The Wizards are officially rebuilt, but the situation is not pretty. The Suns have officially entered into a big gamble, but follow-up actions are needed. Paul said he found out about this on the plane and was surprised. For him, this was like a fateful blow. From the perspective of winning the championship, it was business class falling into economy class. He is 38 years old, and the Wizards don't look like they can win the championship in the short term. Unless he is waived by the Wizards and goes to another strong team, it is very likely that he will never win a championship. Of course, the Wizards' deal was not a good one: many of the previous moves by the Washington Wizards over the years were not very noteworthy, including but not limited to: letting Porter go when his value was at its highest (Warriors fans applauded), five-year 80 million extension Bertans was acquired (not a good deal in hindsight), KCP was given away for nothing (Nuggets fans applauded), Wall and Beal all held on to it for too long and did not take action when the value was highest. Bill ended up replacing the 38-year-old Paul, Shamet and a bunch of second-round picks, which was really not a good idea for a rebuilding team. In other words: Westbrook ranks ninth in assists in NBA history, Thunder → Rockets → Wizards → Clippers. Wall ranks 46th in assists in NBA history, Wizards → Rockets → Clippers. Paul ranks third in assists in NBA history, Clippers → Rockets → Thunder → Suns → Wizards. Wizards, Rockets, Clippers: Bad, we have become a star point guard transit station... But on the other side, the Suns got Bill's big contract and started to gamble... It may not be as wonderful as it looks on paper. At best: Beal is about to turn 30, Booker is 26, Ayton is 24, and Durant is 34 - and he averaged 29 points per game last season. The age structure and personal attack power are both very good-looking. Durant: Westbrook + Harden, Curry + Clay, Harden + Irving, Booker + Beal - wow haha, another pair of star backcourts! But if you think about it, the Suns have to overcome many problems: Bradley Beal, a three-time All-Star guard, followed Wall to three consecutive Eastern Conference semifinals, averaging 30 points per game in the 2019-21 seasons. When it comes to holding the ball, he has the ability to break away concisely and clearly, patiently and meticulously grasp the game record, and is good at changing the center of gravity. There are no blind spots for shooting inside the three-point line, and his steps are sophisticated and cunning: jumping, retreating, and making sudden stops are all very good. In terms of not having the ball, he has been praised as early as in Florida, but compared with Ray Allen, he moves erratically and is good at fake moves without the ball; the most remarkable thing is that after receiving the ball on the weak side, he attacks the replacement: shooting, After three threats and sudden bursts, he was great. He is very good at anything that involves playing with the opponent's center of gravity. Bill is probably such a player: he doesn't have a decisive move, but has many attack methods; conversely, he is accurate everywhere, but he is not a fatal attacker. An inappropriate analogy...the guard version of Ingram? However: after the Suns lost Paul, they lost a court-controlling person, and Bill was not good at setting the plate: in the Wizards for so many years, Wall and Westbrook were more responsible for setting up the plate, and he was responsible for the offense; he can instigate it himself, But he is not a full-time organizational core. His off-ball skills are very good, but as mentioned above, he is not a capable long-range shooter. In the past five seasons, his three-point percentage has not reached 37%. Booker: Well, my career three-point rate is less than 36%... Durant: So I am the best shooter on the team now? Here’s the problem: Bill, Booker and Durant are not considered the main driving force, and they are all suitable to serve as the team’s secondary ball handlers: moving on the weak side, starting, attacking, playing two-man roles, they are familiar with it, and they get 30 in a game. It's like playing. But the three of them are now on the same team. The team's best long-range shooting threat is Durant: but he is 34 years old and cannot run back and forth the entire game. The team's best off-ball skill may be Bill, but he probably has to push the ball past half court? This is just a matter between three people, there are others. In the playoffs last season, the Suns relied on their two aces to shoot 20 shots per game. Paul shot 13 baskets per game and Ayton made 11. Bill is not Paul: He shot 18 baskets per game with the Wizards. Even if the three of them can adjust to each other, how many shooting opportunities are left for the team's fourth leader, Ayton? If you were playing video games, you could have said, ""Ayton, you're responsible for eating the cake and defending anyway."" But Ayton is not Gobert's ""it doesn't matter if you don't give me shots, I'm just a blue-collar"" character. Don't feed him enough passes to make him feel involved. He will really show you how soft he is on both offense and defense. It would be great if the team had a dispatcher who could make the whole team happy; but the Suns don't seem to have such a person at the moment. Before Paul left, the defense was no longer at its peak, but the newcomer Bill - to put it politely - was never good at defense; and Paul has returned from old age, and his defensive vision and communication skills are still there, but Bill is not good at it. The Suns' new coach is Coach Vogel. Everyone knows that he is good at leading defense - the Pacers back then, the 2020 champion Lakers - but coach Vogel also has a habit: He needs to rely on a large lineup to lead good defense. When he was with the Pacers, he asked Paul George, George Hill, and Hibbert to stand hand in hand and say, ""How big are you? You have to use this size!"" When he was with the Lakers, McGee was the striker/ Dwight + thick eyebrows + LeBron. The current Suns are far from the formation that Coach Vogel likes. They still lack thickness on the wings and need a 3D point guard. If they can have a healthy big ball, or an old Kidd, it will be much better; if they also have Mikal Bridges, the wing length and leading defense can be easily solved. Unfortunately, they have lost the bridge. Therefore, the Suns now need a 3D court controller and a wing who can defend multiple positions in order to form a strong formation; but now, they have extremely limited room for adjustment: the big contracts of the three aces have backlogged their operating space. Ayton is at a time when his trade value is at its lowest, and he is the team's only reliable long-term player. Regardless of whether he trades for him or not, it is not a good time. It doesn't matter in the regular season. The Suns can live by relying on their three aces to take over in turns. But in the playoffs, problems with defense, wing thickness, and game rhythm will arise: Just like this season's playoffs, in the first round against the Clippers, who were full of injured soldiers, Booker and Durant can attack easily Passed the test; when meeting the championship team Nuggets, they still relied on Booker + Durant to fight, and the situation was not very good; after the Nuggets saw through their routine, they were taken away in a wave in the sixth game. What about next season? The thickness and defense are the same as before, relying on Booker + Durant + Bill to fight hard? So: It depends on whether the Suns trade Ayton, whether they can sign cheap veterans (guards who can defend and yell, snake oil defenders on the wing), and whether coach Vogel can get a large lineup that he is comfortable with. Otherwise, the Suns' current lineup alone may look beautiful on paper, but it's still not easy to win the championship. #BillPaulExchangeClub#",,,,Bill Paul swaps owners,9,60,199,6/20/23 0:07,Weibo web version,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hf3zabhc1jj30qo0f0nbi.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hf3zac02t1j30oa0bown5.jpg']",,

4.91E+15,N5siX98Pz,3265788052,Vicious NBA,"Today, because of a conversation with Beverly, Mr. Tang was involved in a bloody storm again. Shooting more three-pointers and becoming a productive and efficient shooter is certainly not a bad thing. But this does not mean that the center's old profession should be thrown away. And now Towns is on the road to losing his old career. Let’s go back to an old question, how to determine what position a player plays? In fact position judgment depends largely on the opponent. If your opponent uses a center to guard you all year round, you are the center. If the point guard is used to guard you all year round, you will be the point guard. So Towns is now a very standard forward, and his opponents often use forwards to defend him. We used to say that the value of a shooting center is to pull the opponent's center out of the penalty area, but now Towns can only pull the opponent's power forward and even small forward out of the penalty area. So what kind of shooting center is that? So what's the problem? Why doesn't the opponent use a center to guard him? Can Towns kneel down and cry and beg/raise his middle finger in provocation and force the opponent's center to come over to solve the problem? The problem is that Towns doesn't have the ability to use his size advantage to punish opposing forwards. This technology is mastered by Jokic and Embiid, and Towns has this obvious shortcoming. My previous judgment about Towns was: He has almost the best shooting skills among centers in NBA history, which makes his style of play unique and of great strategic value. But the current judgment is: he is a shooting power forward with good shooting skills but not unique. Top Mirotic can do this kind of thing, top Saric can do it, and even some poor versions like the Morris brothers can do it. A center with superb shooting skills and a forward with superb shooting skills have completely different strategic meanings. What Beverly said was nice, not even ridiculous. Towns is indeed a center with extremely offensive talent. But the premise is that he must first learn to be a center.",,,,,2,28,129,6/15/23 21:16,Weibo web version,['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/c2a7f894ly1hez7umn9gzj20dr0czteh.jpg'],,

The Nuggets, the league's No. 1 team in terms of strength, won this year's championship with a score of 4-1. Jokic won the FMVP with an absolute advantage. I believe many people are questioning whether this year's Nuggets can defeat the Lakers led by Kobe Bryant 08-10. I believe this is the answer that Murray, the second player in charge of the Nuggets, wants to answer most, because he once talked about his most wanted to defeat the Lakers led by Kobe Bryant at his peak. Of course, as a Nuggets player, I am also a fan of Mamba. I saw that Kobe Bryant's Lakers defeated the Nuggets led by Anthony for three consecutive years and prevented the Nuggets from winning the championship. This is a pity. Too strong. Let’s get back to the point. This year’s Nuggets are really strong. But as a fan of 15 years like me, from what I know, this year’s Nuggets are still not strong enough to compete with the 2008-10 Lakers. Can fight. How to put it this way, the NBA league has reduced physical confrontations more and more, and has been greatly relieved in terms of physical fitness. So in terms of physical strength, the Lakers are more stable and have an advantage. From this point of view, the Lakers win. After all, physical fitness is also an important part of the game. Now let’s talk about the comparison of players. Everyone knows that the leader of the Nuggets is Jokic. Jokic has won the regular season MVP for two consecutive years. This is great. Jokic’s playing style is to play high and high. , with physical crushing and mid-range shooting skills and flexible footsteps. Being vulnerable makes many defenders unable to defend. But everyone should not forget that it is difficult to display the Lakers' double height. Of course, when it comes to these, many people will think that two people defending Jokic will be shot to death by the Nuggets' three-pointer. But don't forget that the Magic back then were a team with a lot of three-point shooters and were still able to defeat them 4-1. What's more, Gasol is also a high-flying player. He also has a very accurate mid-range shot and flexible feet. He also has teammates like Kobe who have very strong passing ability, so Gasol is not inferior to Jokic. , although Jokic has won the MVP for two consecutive years, and Gasol has no MVP. The Lakers also have Bynum, who is taller than anyone in the Nuggets except Jokic. Single-line defeat Now, comparing the outside line to the Nuggets, no one can guard Kobe Bryant alone. There is no doubt about this. They all think Gordon’s defense is very good, but his defense against Kobe is far worse. Gordon will be fouled by Kobe. and blow up. Furthermore, Kobe's passing skills are also top-notch. Compared with that era, the Lakers' perimeter defense was known to win games with defense. Except for Jokic, the Lakers can defend anyone in one-on-one defense. The Nuggets except Murray and Jokic have some mid-range shooting ability, but others can't. . But Murray's defense is weak and cannot guard Odom and the Lakers' Kobe Bryant. Nuggets group picture As long as the Lakers can defeat the Nuggets 4-2 when everyone is healthy, defense determines the direction of the championship. The Nuggets are indeed very strong this year, but the Lakers' substitutes are also better than the Nuggets. Much better. The Nuggets' championship this year was indeed due to the performance of several main players, but no one could guard the twin towers of Kobe and the Lakers. The Lakers can defend anyone individually, but they have to rely on attrition to defeat the Nuggets. The Heat were defeated 4-1 this year, but the Heat are missing two players with stable mid-range shooting, namely Oladipo and Ciro. The Lakers can defeat the Celtics in winning FMVP, but the Nuggets do not have this ability. After all, Garnett can guard Jokic alone, and the Celtics are physically crushing. Once the Nuggets are guarded against Jokic, The Nuggets have no chance. Haha, this is the editor’s opinion. If you have any suggestions, please leave them in the comment area/Thank you everyone.",,,,,1,0,0,6/15/23 14:58,Weibo web version,,,

Lakers legend Jerry West recently talked about James breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record and crowning the all-time scoring champion on Paul George's podcast. When asked if he imagined that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record would one day be broken by James, West said: ""Oh, of course, what we got is a player with unique skills and a unique size, and I think he becomes even better as a shooter.

4.91E+15,N5l1DxXUt,1102253035,Basketball Sports News,"There are only two kinds of dunks in the NBA, one is Carter's dunk, and the other is other people's dunks. There are many outstanding dunkers in NBA history, such as Jordan, LaVine, Aaron Gordon, etc., but the most watchable one is undoubtedly Carter. He combines strength, elegance and beauty. In 2000, he relied on dunks to save the NBA ratings when Jordan left. Moreover, Carter was In the Olympics, a dunk was also performed in actual combat. This dunk is also known as the dunk of death. As a guard, Carter's number of dunks is definitely not as high as that of a center, but he is indeed a leader in the same position. Carter's 741 dunks in his career rank third among backcourts in history. At his peak, Carter was also a superstar-level player in the league. He averaged 27.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.1 blocks per game. Carter played a total of 22 seasons in his career and was the longest-serving player in history. It is estimated that The future will be broken by James. The best shooter ""I didn't dare to say that I was the best shooter in history before I became the three-point king in history, but now I dare to say so."" This is Curry's acceptance after surpassing Ray Allen's historical three-point hit total. What he said in the interview is that Curry is now the three-point king in history, and he has also brought the traditional basketball era into the small ball era with his excellent three-point shooting ability. Curry has too many three-point records, such as three-point hits in a single season. 402 three-pointers, averaging 5.3 three-pointers per game in a single season, etc. Although Curry is now 35 years old, he is still at his peak level. This season, he averaged 29.6 points, 6.1 rebounds, 6.3 assists and 1 steal per game. He shot 49% from the field and 42.6% from the three-point range. He can hit 4.9 three-pointers, which is very good. Curry has hit 3,376 three-pointers so far in his career. It should not be a big problem for Curry to increase his career three-pointers to 4,000+ when he retires. There are many outstanding scorers in history, such as Durant, the youngest scoring champion in history, and Chamberlain, who averaged the highest 50 points per game in a single season in history. However, the best scorer in history will undoubtedly be Jordan. Jordan has the most scoring titles in the history of his 10th career, three more than the second most in history. His career average of 30.12 points per game is the highest in history, and his playoff average of 33.4 points is the highest in history. Jordan also has a record of 63 points in a single game in the playoffs. , and no one can match it. The reason why Jordan can become the strongest scorer in history is because he has the talent to hit everyone in the wrong position. All the top scorers in history have this talent. Jordan relies on the strongest ability to stay in the air in history. He was able to wait until the defender was down before taking action, and Jordan's first step when he was young was very fast and extremely explosive. Jordan's waist and abdomen were very strong. His back was basically half-body perpendicular to the ground, and it looked the same as a normal shot. It also made Jordan very easy to kill inside and outside. The Best Defenders There are many outstanding defensive players in history, such as Uncle Mu, who once relied on his excellent defense to lead the team to defeat the SuperSonics, such as Bill Russell. It was precisely because of Russell that he became the best defender. They won the championship with that defense, but there were no defensive statistics in Russell's era, so they suffered a loss. According to the American media, the best defensive player in history is Olajuwon. Won the best defensive player twice. Moreover, Olajuwon is the historical leader in blocks, and his number of steals is also ranked tenth in history. It is rare for a center to use steals so well. At the peak of his career, Olajuwon averaged 21.2 points per game. 13.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 2.2 steals, and 3.9 blocks. Such defensive statistics are rarely seen in the league today. It is worth mentioning that Olajuwon also achieved blocks + points + twice. A quadruple-double of rebounds + assists! The best passer is Magic. Although Stockton is the all-time assists leader and has won the assists title for 9 consecutive years, Magic is the player with the most assists per game in history. , reaching 11.2 times. If Magic hadn't been too short in his career, if he could have played for more than 18 years like Stockton, he would probably be the all-time assist leader. Even if his career only lasted for 13 years, his number of assists would still be the same. Reached seventh in history. Compared with most point guards, Magic's passing is more enjoyable and has a higher success rate. Because Magic is this tall, his vision and overall view are more advantageous, and he is more capable in the playoffs. It shows how outstanding a player's assists are. Magic is the player with the most assists in the history of the playoffs. In the playoffs, the total number of assists in a single game exceeds 20+. Magic has 10 times, while Stockton, who is second in history, only has 4. This time, the gap is obvious, which is why Magic is called the first point guard in history. The most comprehensive player is undoubtedly James. Although Westbrook is the player with the most triple-doubles in history, and he and Big O are the only two players in history to average a triple-double per game in a season, but If James wants to achieve these, it will not be difficult for him, and James has also set a record recently. He is the only player in history who is over 38 years old and has won two triple-doubles. Even at this stage of his career, Lao James still Able to fully demonstrate oneself. Whether he can deliver a triple-double in the playoffs may be a more intuitive way to see whether a player is very comprehensive. It is better than Westbrook's 10 playoff triple-doubles in his career, ranking fourth in history. James has scored a total of 23 triple-doubles in his career, second only to Magic. James’ career triple-doubles are also ranked fourth in history. Although his scoring, rebounds, assists and defense are not the strongest, they are at their peak. He was also at the top of the league during that period. He was also selected as the best first defense 5 times, which is very outstanding. The strongest rebounder. Is Chamberlain the strongest rebounder? After all, Chamberlain is the historical rebounding champion, and he has won 11 rebounding champions in his 13-year career. His dominance in rebounding is not inferior to Jordan's dominance in scoring, but surprisingly, the US media has regarded this as The honor was given to Bill Russell. Russell is second on the all-time rebounding list. The reason why this honor was given to him is that I think the American media values more the playoff record. Russell's total in the playoffs Number of rebounds 4104, first in history. Chamberlain ranks second in history with a total of 3,913 points. In terms of rebounds per game, Russell still ranks first, surpassing the coach. Bill Russell is the famous tiebreaker king in history. He has played in tiebreakers 10 times in his career. As a result, Russell never lost a single game, and Russell averaged 18.6 points and 32.3 rebounds per game. Just look at this rebounding data to see how terrifying he is. In the current league, the five starters of a team may not add up. Being able to get so many rebounds in a single game, it doesn't matter who is the strongest between him and Chamberlain. The best player is undoubtedly Michael Jordan. After all, he is the first player in NBA history. The reason why Jordan became the first person in history is because of his influence and honor. Jordan promoted basketball to the world, which was more influential than Curry who promoted basketball from the traditional basketball era to the small ball era. Moreover, Curry's small ball era has not yet become universal around the world, but Jordan made basketball known to fans around the world. Then in terms of honors, Jordan is the player who has won the most FMVPs in the finals in history, and he has never lost in the finals. This is where the first man has no solution. The competition between the super giants is the number of FMVPs. Historically, The one with the closest number of FMVPs to Jordan is James, but James only has 4 in total. In addition, Jordan also has some of his scoring records mentioned above, etc. Jordan is so inexplicable. He is incredible in many aspects. Even though he was born in this small ball era, Jordan relies on his talent and competitiveness, I believe he can achieve success. #nba##nbaTucaoConference#",,,,"NBA, nba complaint conference",0,0,4,6/15/23 2:44,Realme GT Full Throttle God of War,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/41b30bebly1heybq8uidaj20u00j0jup.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/41b30bebly1heybq94lpoj20u00huwhw.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/ 41b30bebly1heybq9fowej20u00hg41p.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/41b30bebly1heybq9nzumj20nm0dagn1.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/41b30bebly1heybqa3ia8j20u00 qajz7.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg. cn/large/41b30bebly1heybqagpsaj20u00iqq7j.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/41b30bebly1heybqas9vij20qo0hu0vw.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/41b30bebly1heybqb4lcuj20 u00lmdku.jpg']",,
4.91E+15,N5jny6Hqn,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"In 2019, Jokic and Murray led the Nuggets to Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals, losing to the Trail Blazers. In 2020, Jokic and Murray led the Nuggets to the Western Conference Finals, losing to the Lakers. Three years later, Jokic and Murray led the Nuggets to win the championship. But the 2023 championship Nuggets are not simply an ""enhanced version of the 2020 Nuggets."" The 2023 champion Nuggets are a mature team with teamwork, tenacity, versatility, swing, clear roles, and solutions on both offense and defense. The Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals in 2020 are actually no longer the same team. It is said that the Nuggets won the championship, and Jokic performed at a historical level: ranking first in total points, first in total rebounds, and first in total assists in the 2023 playoffs, which is the only one in history. But it’s actually nothing new: Although some people will criticize Jokic for “winning two MVPs and getting nothing”, Jokic has always been outstanding on the offensive end in the playoffs. Played in the playoffs for the first time in 2019, two seven games: averaging 25+13+8 per game, shooting 51%+39%+85%. Reached the Western Conference Finals in 2020, averaging 24+10+6 per game and shooting 52%+43%+84%. In 2021, Murray was absent and the team was swept by the Suns in the second round, but: averaged 30+12+5 per game and hit 51%+38%+84%. In 2022, Murray and Porter were absent and lost to the championship Warriors in the first round, but: averaged 31+13+6 per game, shooting 58%+28%+85%. Jokic averaged 30+14+10 per game in the playoffs this season, which is definitely the best in his career. But the biggest difference between this year and previous years is: the Nuggets carefully constructed and Jokic waited patiently to develop a championship team. From 2019 to 2020, the Nuggets' basic rotation: Jokic + Murray, Harris and Morris in the backcourt, Patton and Craig on the wings, Plumlee and Millsap Sr. in the interior, and Grant Jr. Jokic's support ability is unrivaled in the world and he is always online; but the Nuggets' three backcourt players at that time were no longer than 193 centimeters, and the forwards were old Millsap and Grant Jr., and Porter Jr. was still in his rookie year. Anyone who experienced the 2020 Western Conference Finals remembers: the Lakers used Dwight to consume Jokic and caused him a lot of fouls; the thick eyebrows were unstoppable in the paint and won the first game; then the thick eyebrows hit a magical buzzer beater in the second game. Got 2-0. The Nuggets won the third game, and Jokic was trapped by 5 fouls in the fourth game. The Nuggets were unable to switch defenses at that time, and were penetrated by Rondo's pass in the fourth quarter; the Lakers 3-1; the Lakers in the fifth game Strength: LeBron stalked Murray, and Jokic with thick eyebrows, taking away the Murray + Jokic duo, LeBron himself hit consecutive jump shots, advancing 4-1. It is said to be 4-1, but three of the four games the Lakers won were fought until the last two minutes. The Lakers, who conceded 106 points per 100 possessions in the regular season, allowed the Nuggets to score 114 points per 100 possessions in this series: The Lakers used Dwight, a special weapon, to entangle Jokic, but they did not curb the Nuggets' overall offense. Porter even became famous in this series. The problem with the 2020 Nuggets is: they are not tough enough and cannot hold on. The next season, the Nuggets did not keep Grant, but used Harris and a first-round pick to acquire Aaron Gordon. I think this deal is comparable to the Pistons acquiring Rasheed Wallace in 2004. Gordon's strengths: A slam-dunk king-level physique, capable of guarding three positions; able to switch defenses, attack the basket, cut inside, rush rebounds, pass the ball, and make up shots. Gordon's shortcomings: Except for his signature dunk, he doesn't have any skills that can be called stunts, so his time in the Magic was also wasted. He and Jokic are a perfect match. Jokic is not good at jumping? Gordon is good at it. Gordon needs someone to throw the ball to him? Jokic said this was a coincidence. Gordon had 496 dunks in seven years with the Magic and 344 dunks in two and a half years with the Nuggets. Gordon's career-high 130 dunks last season increased to 181 this season - his most dunks in one year with the Magic were 104. Last season, Jokic gave Gordon 147 assists, third in the league, 112 of which went directly to the basket. Jokic has given Gordon 155 assists this season, second in the league, 130 of which went directly to the basket. Of course, the journey has not been smooth. After reaching the peak of his career in the 2020 playoffs, Murray was injured and rested for a year and a half. He cried and asked Coach Malone if he would give up on him. Coach Malone said, no. After Porter Jr. played his career masterpiece in the 2020-21 season, he signed a long-term contract and then was injured for a whole season. Jokic led the Nuggets without Murray and lost to the Suns in 2021; he led the Nuggets without Murray and Porter to survive the 2021-22 season. Set incredible records: leading the team in scoring, rebounding, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season. Then, this season. Finally everyone is ready. The team recruited championship guard KCP, selected Braun, ""a college champion player with no outstanding skills but a strong desire to win"", and signed Bruce with the 42nd pick in the draft, ""no outstanding skills but a very hardworking player"" Brown. They, plus Gordon, are all hard-working players who have no unique skills but can defend three positions. Porter Jr. was a mess in the finals, but he scored 17 points on 13 shots per game in the regular season, allowing Murray and Jokic to fish a little. ——Murray scored 20 points on 16 shots in 33 minutes per game in the regular season, and 26 points on 21 shots in 40 minutes per game in the playoffs. ——Jokic averaged less than 15 shots per game in the regular season. He didn’t play much in the last three weeks of the regular season, and he almost averaged 25+12+10, 63%+38%+82% per game. , leaving enough energy for the playoffs: averaging 30+14+10 per game in the playoffs. In particular, the Nuggets have practiced a new defense: before, the Nuggets defended the pick-and-roll by retreating more often and not being ruthless enough, so there was a rumor that ""playing Jokic in the pick-and-roll can kill him!"" But this season, the Nuggets' defense has changed. Now: Jokic can go to the line to participate in the double attack, and Gordon/Porter rotate under the basket: Jokic is seven feet tall, Porter is 208 centimeters, Gordon is 203 centimeters, three seven-foot wingspan, a giant striker. Jokic can also sit in the penalty area and the rest of the team switch defenses: For example, in the finals, in addition to Gordon's stubborn pursuit of Jimmy Butler, Porter, Bruce, and KCP can all face him. The Nuggets are essentially a swing team: Gordon at No. 4 is a slam dunk master, a jack-of-all-trades, and a master of perimeter defense. Porter, No. 3, is a 208cm high shooter. Murray, No. 1, is an explosive scorer. Bruce Brown can guard three positions and do a little bit of everything. KCP is the 2020 championship team 3D. Braun is a 201-centimeter cutter who can defend all perimeter positions. Even Jokic's substitute, Jeff Green, was known as the most versatile No. 3 in the country at Georgetown. When he went to the Thunder, he changed to the No. 4 to accommodate Durant, and became the No. 5 when he got older. And the fat white center with the most comprehensive offensive skills in NBA history. Porter performed well in the first round and the series against the Lakers. In Game 5 of the Finals, he frequently made strong attacks when he needed to cut inside. Gordon's defensive end was extremely effective in guarding LeBron, Jimmy, Durant, and Booker. When he needed to take action in Game 4 of the Finals, he destroyed Miami. KCP and Bruce Brown are gritty. Braun shined in the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the Finals. Murray could score explosively against the Suns and Lakers, and by the time he was targeted in the Finals, he had 10 assists in four consecutive games. Jokic, if you flank him, he will beat you with 10 assists in the half; if you don’t flank him, he will beat you with 30 points every day; if you let him go to the line, he will shoot a three-pointer; if you lock in a three-pointer, he will rush towards the basket. ...Then after the playoffs, he ranked first in the league in total points, total rebounds and total assists: no one can stop him. Jokic and Murray's abilities have always been there. But the Nuggets' size advantage, giant striker, team trust, chemical reaction, offensive and defensive chemistry, and fighting spirit were developed over time. Three years ago, there was no such thing. The Nuggets have no All-Stars except Jokic. Why are the players on the championship team less successful elsewhere? They waited for Murray for a year and a half and Porter for a year. Jokic activated Gordon, and Gordon provided the panacea the team needed. The Magic had Gordon, but they still let him come to the Nuggets. The Nets owned Bruce Brown, but the Nuggets gave him a two-year contract. The Lakers had KCP, but the Nuggets gave him a three-year contract. Jeff Green moved to 11 teams, and Jordan also saw the world with Paul and Griffin, but he only won the championship with the Nuggets. The Nuggets are second in the league in assists this season, second only to the Warriors. The average of 2.18 dribbles per touch is the third-fewest in the league—the only players with fewer dribbles than them are the Warriors and Kings. Pass, block, run. The construction of the system and the integration of the puzzle. On the night of the championship, coach Malone said that he was most proud of the Nuggets' defense. ""When the offense was not going well, we worked like a dog on the defensive end."" ——In 2020, the Nuggets cannot hold on; in 2023, they can hold on. After the first game of the Finals, Porter said, ""We are selfless and we want everyone to succeed. This is the culture of our team."" Gordon said, ""Every time I see Gordon is open, every time I pass the ball Give it to him, no matter what happens. Because passing to the open space is the right choice."" Porter's summary is, ""We all try to play like this."" So who takes the lead in this play? ""Nikola is the beginning of it all."" It's not ""Jokic and Murray played peak data and led a group of role players forward"", but ""Jokic led the Nuggets team, sizing up the situation, both offensive and defensive ends. They worked hard, faced all opponents, and finally won the championship."" A true leader can capture all the data and glory, but that is only on paper. Behind the scenes is persistence and patience in playing the right game, allowing every teammate who was always just a little short of the championship to integrate into a swinging, comprehensive, and team championship team. #DenverNuggetsMakeHistory#",,,,Denver Nuggets make history,63,78,627,6/14/23 22:33,Weibo web version,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hey4gzwn8dj30xc0m8afl.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hey4h0edsvj30qo0hs0ua.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 005ztwqOgy1hey4h0rxehj30hu0b347r.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hey4h19u62j30yd0i24gh.jpg']",,
4.91E+15,N5iZzbGKT,7762399751,SEPIAS-Daily Ball Blind Essence,"""Ballblind's 2023 Mock Draft and Rookie Report"" is written in front: Purpose and Methods The format of this report to evaluate each rookie will be to use three sentences to describe the characteristics of the player, plus two NBA players that I think are closest to the player's immediate combat role. template. The purpose of this format is to allow readers to understand the characteristics of rookies more quickly and accurately. Many Chinese and English draft reports on the Internet make me feel that they are not good enough. On the one hand, some reports ignore or misinterpret key information, and the evaluation of players is incomplete, inaccurate, or contains too much speculation; on the other hand, some reports may leave out a large part of the main issues, but dwell on a large number of details and make them redundant. There is too much residual information and the presentation lacks priority. When writing this topic, I will try my best to fully understand and judge a player from the major aspects of main attack, space, finishing, passing and control, rebounding, individual defense, and assist defense, and then based on the player's position, role, and characteristics. Make choices when presenting information. I will not go into detail about the micro-information such as ""a certain player's right turn jump hook is very good"", but will try to reflect the main information that I think readers need to know most about the player in the corresponding role. Player templates reflect the player's style positioning, not the level of completion. When selecting a template, I will focus more on the immediate combat ability level, because many rookie reports will have templates such as ""Kuminga's main attack = letter"" and ""Okoro's shooting = Anunoby"". In this way, everyone's template is a star with no major weaknesses, which makes the template meaningless. You know, Kawaii doesn't know a certain skill at all when he debuts like this, and only a handful of them become great masters in the end. Therefore, when I choose a template, I will mainly base it on the player's immediate combat ability level, and may assume that he has made some actual progress in some aspects, in order to more accurately and realistically reflect his existing characteristics. The ranking criterion is my subjective judgment on ""the average expectation of a certain player's career in all parallel universes."" I will briefly talk about the reasons for the rankings and personal reflections after each section, but these are just random thoughts and are not as rigorous as the player brief descriptions. Many players may be brief or even not mentioned. I would like to state here that I do not think that ranking is the main purpose and value of this series. It is more of a way for me to promote my personal basketball values, and a fun reward for myself after spending a lot of energy looking up information and writing reports. Figure 1: - There may not be many rookies who can achieve reliable rotation in the first year. But for Vunbanyama, I think he's probably going to be a quality starter-caliber player in his first year. His basic skills are already at the level of immediate combat effectiveness. What is most likely to lower his level of influence is the decrease in efficiency caused by shouldering an excessive burden of main attack. -The battle between Henderson and Miller is a typical battle between the ceiling and the floor. Most lists and myself believe that Miller's floor guarantee will be better this year. I once wanted to rank Amen Thompson ahead of Henderson, thinking that it would be better to choose someone with a better body and a higher ceiling anyway. But his playing level in OTE is really difficult to judge. -Personally, I think Whittemore has the best combination of physical and technical skills among the remaining rookies, and his shooting output is also acceptable. This is why he stands out in my ranking. Figure 2: - Ranking Hendricks and Hawkins higher than expected is probably due to my preference for immediate strength and spacing. -Wallace will become a very useful player as long as he develops a signature skill. -As for Osar, his brother's movement control does seem to be better than his, but I can't tell whether this is a difference in tendency or level, because the reference of the OTE league is really questionable. I actually don't see much difference between him and Amen. The ranking of these two people, like their future development, can only be guessed. Figure 3: - I ranked Dick behind Hawkins because I think the former is more balanced offensively and defensively, but in fact the two should be about the same at this point in time. Dick's movement is impressive, reminiscent of Huerter next to Savoy. -Bafkin is a non-three-point pick-and-roll player that I am relatively optimistic about. He defends and attacks the frame very well, and he is also good at fixed-point three-pointers and free throws. Free throws are actually a data that reflects the shooting mechanism of young players. It is very valuable in understanding rookies, especially when there are insufficient three-point samples. -Blake actually belongs to the previous level, but I don't like this type of player. For contemporary NBA outsiders, there is no shooting, and all movement and control skills are castles in the air. But it would make sense if he were drafted at No. 7. Figure 4: -I obviously jumped on Podemski in this pick. The way he plays and his style reminds me of Tyrell Terry, the same player I drafted three years ago. He is bigger than Terry. Although his athletic ability and body are not good, players like Bogdan and Herro are not without successful precedents. Figure 5: - I am not optimistic about inefficient main attackers like Cifino and Smith. I like Prosper and Lubert more than them, because I think the probability of the latter two practicing qualified fixed points is much higher than The first two have become qualified main attackers. Prosper's popularity is said to have surged, which may be related to this reason. Figure 6: - Trayce Jackson-Davis is my favorite player. He is several years older than the players he competes with in the NCAA, but he has no major technical problems. I would expect him to be a Rooney-style utility player. -Hucks is an interesting player. I see through his body the soul of twenty or thirty years ago. If he can improve his unstable three-point shooting to the level of a qualified fixed-point shooter, his main offensive skills will be a major plus. - Koulibaly is someone I don’t admire. He gives the impression that he is good at everything but can’t play basketball. The following is in no particular order starting from the second round. Figure 7: -Leonard Miller, many people will regard him as a striker, but I think he is more like an insider like Van Der Biao or Dwight Powell. The vacuum level may not be bad, but as an outside shooter, there is no shooting, and as an inside post, there is no defense, so the compatibility is very awkward. Figure 8: - Suther, I really read his draft report for four years. The last person to have this experience was Ochai Abaji. Figure 9: - Strawser shoots so fast. -I think Clintman will be worse than he looks. His matchup on the defensive end will be a problem. He won't be able to protect the rim when he plays center. He may not be able to catch up on the outside. His athletic ability is average, and his weak side rim protection is also a question mark. The second round ends when you are ranked 45th, because the success rate of the people after that is not high. It can also be said that, in addition to the thirty or so first-round prospects on each list, I also picked a dozen or so people who I thought were pretty good among the remaining forty or fifty people who had appeared on various lists. . Finally, please let me express my slight sadness about Grant Nelson withdrawing from the draft, and let us look forward to my carefully written draft preview for him next year. Time is limited, and data is not as easy to obtain as in the NBA. If there are any omissions, please forgive me.",,,,,7,19,49,6/14/23 21:34,Weibo web version,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/008tkeLZgy1hey2pplnqoj317z0y47wh.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/008tkeLZgy1hey2pq4u54j317z0y44qp.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/ 008tkeLZgy1hey2pqjndej317z0y47wh.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/008tkeLZgy1hey2pr6hlij317z0y44qp.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/008tkeLZgy1hey2ps3dlbj317z0 y47wh.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg. cn/large/008tkeLZgy1hey2psl67oj317z0y44qp.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/008tkeLZgy1hey2pt0uk4j317z0y44qp.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/008tkeLZgy1hey2ptiufq j317z0y44qp.jpg', 'https:// wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/008tkeLZgy1hey2ptwt7fj317z0y44qp.jpg']",,

4.91E+15,N58NUugOJ,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[The examples of the Nuggets and Jokic may only prove one thing] There is no surprise. The Heat made the final resistance, but the Nuggets still successfully won the cup today. They only lost 4 games in the 4-round series. The Suns, who won two games against them, actually lost the most points to them. The Nuggets beat their opponents by 8 points in 100 rounds in the playoffs. What is the concept? This data, the 22 Warriors are 4.9, the 21 Bucks are 5.3, the 20 Lakers are 6.9, and the 19 Raptors are 5.6 - the Nuggets seem to have more dominance over their opponents in the season than the championships in the past 4 years. If Considering that the 18th Warriors and 18th Rockets were inseparable, the last team to surpass the Nuggets' dominance in the season was the 17th Warriors. Viewing can corroborate the data. The Nuggets' offense is too strong. Compared to the champions who crawled out of the defensive quagmire, the Nuggets, who have sparks and lightning all the way, seem to be more capable. The most dangerous moment their offense encountered was probably in the fourth quarter of G1 of the Western Conference Finals. At that time, you couldn't guess that Murray would beat everything. Jokic's ability to turn logical defensive tricks into invisible is also exaggerated. But they can do it consistently and steadily. The Nuggets defeated at least three top defensive teams, one with Gobert, one with the thick eyebrows that just picked up DPOY, and one with the highest defensive rating in the league, and they all visibly lost. The Nuggets can't help it. Dunbao said: ""Look, what's the difference if you work hard or not?"" So have the Nuggets proven that ""defense wins championships"" no longer applies? In fact, the Nuggets' defensive efficiency ranks fourth in the league in the playoffs. The three teams ahead of them, the Grizzlies and Cavaliers, all lost in the first round and each lost their swamp battle. The other team in front is the Knicks. Their defense mainly relies on their opponents' inability to make shots. Although the Nuggets' defense has not been highly rated over the past many years, this year's regular season is only in the middle of the league, and their stubborn problems facing top backcourt pick-and-roll teams cannot be said to have been eliminated - in the first round Facing Huazi and Booker in the second round, this weakness will still be exposed - but if you have watched the Nuggets' playoffs this year in full, you will definitely agree that the defensive data they submitted does not have much water. , they have good discipline and have maintained their traditional advantages such as rebounding and controlling fouls. Almost everyone around Jokic has provided strong confrontation resistance, and Jokic's own defense has gotten better and better the more he plays. Like a wall of sighs. At least in the playoffs, the Nuggets have proven their defense. Malone, Jokic, and the Nuggets emphasized defense far more often than offense in interviews. But here we still need to emphasize the omitted presupposition of the so-called ""defense wins championships"": the NBA is a league where stars dominate the game. People believe that when the offense cannot open up the situation, you can give the ball to the big brother, but you cannot emphasize defense when you want to Picking it up casually requires team configuration and training reserves. This is why all teams, especially championship teams, are emphasizing this aspect. Compared with offense, defense is more about the team than the star attribute. It is a ""fault tolerance mechanism"" when the team's shooting is not good and the big brother is in poor condition. It allows the team to retreat to a corner and still have a ""security"" . From this perspective, the Nuggets are indeed more like an ""offense wins championship"" team, because their ""security"" comes from offense rather than defense. The best example of this is the Western Conference Finals. The Nuggets can accept to get out of the way in some rim-protecting rounds to allow the Lakers to lay up, and give up interfering with some shots, thereby avoiding getting into greater foul trouble. The courage to do this is out of absolute confidence in one's own offense. In this series, the Nuggets' defensive efficiency was 116.1, the worst among the four rounds, but they returned the favor with their best offensive efficiency of 122.3 in the four rounds. In the 20 playoff games, there were only 4 games in which the Nuggets' offensive efficiency was lower than 110. The only games in which the Nuggets' offensive efficiency was lower than 100 were excessive excitement and no one could make a three-pointer. If you think back to the Nuggets' past experience, they have also won two rounds against the 20 Jazz and 21 Trail Blazers. If you only look at the offense of the Jazz and Trail Blazers, you can't imagine how they could be eliminated - -The Nuggets have the ability to fight back, even if Mitchell and Lillard made 33 and 35 three-pointers respectively. Even the Nuggets, who did not have Murray and Porter last year, were able to compete with the eventual champion Warriors. Jokic and his Nuggets are showing us the possibility that they may truly be undefendable. The Miami Heat have proven their defensive comprehensiveness in the playoffs in recent years. Spoelstra always has tricks you can't think of to solve problems, but Spoelstra admitted that they can't guard Jokic and the Nuggets. Jokic provides the ultimate reliability on the offensive end. He proved to be the best defender in two groups of 4/5 position defenses with super rim protectors (Gobert/Towns, Nongmei/Hachimura). It is also impossible to resist him head-on, at least not to block his frontal attack and interspersed support at the same time. Choosing either of these two moves has already reached a lethal dose. If you want to restrict Jokic relatively effectively, you may have to put two top talents and defensive insiders at the same time. For example, have Gobert + thick eyebrows at the same time, one to defend, and the other to defend against Gordon. Note that it must be the top talent, and the knight-level twin towers will be pulled to A. Will the letters of Bucks + Daluo be the combination closest to this standard? But in their recent encounters, asking teachers to meet them is more like a dimensionality-reducing blow to them. Murray is a ""super punisher"" who cannot be ignored. His ""super game transformation"" in the playoffs may be an important factor in the failure of a large number of ball commentators to be fully optimistic about the Nuggets championship before the start of the playoffs. factor. The following two sets of data: A.17.8+3+6.2, true shooting percentage 60.5% B.20+4+6.2, true shooting percentage 57.1% B, who averages 2.2 points more per game, is better than A, whose true shooting percentage is slightly higher how much? Their BPM, EPM, and even salary are almost the same. To say that they are players of the same level is not an exaggeration, right? However, A is Russell and B is Jamal Murray. Murray is infinitely better in the playoffs than in the regular season. You wouldn't have guessed that he could transform again. Even though he proved in the 20-year park that he has another form that can be activated, there are many reasons not to To support your belief that Murray is real: Are the park data representative? Murray had only played in the playoffs two years before this; he suffered major injuries and looked hopeless at times during the season. If Murray is really only at the level of the regular season, I am sure that the Nuggets will not win the championship trophy today. Even if they can get to this position, the series will be far more difficult than the current situation. But now, Murray in the championship season and Murray in the park have confirmed each other, truly showing people an inexplicable but real playoff transformation style. He is proficient in all kinds of difficult mid-ranges and has always been a big-hearted shooter. He delivered impressive passing control and defense, and played a qualified second-in-command on the Nuggets' road to the championship. It was he who allowed the Nuggets to crawl out of the quagmire without immediately destroying the Lakers' position 4/5 defense, and this became a key breaking point for the team to win the opponent in one go. It was also he who made the Heat waver in their defensive strategy. He unconventionally used the suicidal strategy of flanking defenders and placing Jokic at the top of the key. Later, he switched to defending Jokic and gave Jokic points. The Heat have no choice. After determining that they can't guard Jokic, the Heat will always choose a strategy that can at least limit the Nuggets' other points. Murray averaged 10.5 assists per game and proved that he is by no means installed by Jokic. With a submachine gun, he can also be an independent soldier. This era - maybe in a few years, people will change it to ""across the era"" - the most buggy interior offensive core, and a player whose level we cannot accurately locate, but who has team attributes and can complete shots from various positions. A big-hearted attacker, together they form the most difficult starting combination to limit. On this basis, every puzzle piece around them shines brightly: Aaron Gordon, who completely bid farewell to the embarrassing position of being neither good with or without the ball in the Magic era, and scored 10 points with 9 points of talent. The explosive performance became Denver's most powerful hammer on the enemy's chest. He and Jokic are a match made in heaven, like the Storm Ax and the God of Thunder, and the Inamitsu of Nagigusa and another God of Thunder; Porter Jr., with his tall posture and proud touch, is another bright weapon for Jokic. A sure-fire move on the bright side. The so-called quick move when they disagree is exactly Denver's most unreasonable winning trick. But then again, which team of kings can tolerate their team's third-highest-paid star to steadily contribute 5 games in the finals with a 14.3% three-point shooting rate? Jokic and his team were able to make Porter, who only had one new trick, ignore the empty basket opportunity of the team leader who was just around the corner, and cut in with raw talent. The finals found their presence. Being a teammate with Jokic saved Porter Jr.; Pope, a hidden dart hidden in Jokic's waist, is launched when the opponent retreats and the weak-side defense is slack, and the shot will be red. The two seasons in which Pope had the lowest share of possessions in his career (excluding his rookie season) were the peak moments of 20 Lakers and 23 Nuggets. When he only needs to do the simplest sniping mission next to the boss, he is a champion defender - although this time in the finals, he is not as amazing as he was three years ago. In fact, Denver's two top shooters were both inaccurate in the Finals; Bruce Brown, I would say last year's playoffs, was he actually very good? At that time, he averaged 14 points per game, with a true shooting percentage of 67.6%. He had vitality to support his cuts, and the three-point line also responded. But you should still remember the Nets' embarrassment at that time. Their center also needed to show value in the lower position, and KD and Irving were not comprehensive traders like Teacher Yue. Moreover, there, Brown will play 34.7 minutes, while in Denver, he only needs to exert energy during the period when the team needs him. I don't want to say that the Nuggets have better depth than that Nets team, after all, the Nuggets only have 6 quality rotations. But the Nuggets do have an environment and style of play that are suitable for Brown, and there may be no big man in the league more suitable than Jokic to drive an energetic small wing - another positive case is Curry and his Payton; Braun and Jeff Green, I love their dynamic. We will also use a magnifying glass to try to find any visible advantages in every player on the championship team, and praise the big guys who are responsible for guarding the water cooler as the best teammates in the locker room. . But objectively speaking, Braun's occasional highlights in the finals are not enough to prove that he is a player worthy of a lot of playoff time. His performance is not stable. Therefore, Malone will use it more and ""go up to support 3~"" It jumps repeatedly between ""5 minutes or even abandoned"". Jeff Green will be slightly better, but he is somewhat inadequate as the first interior substitute for the championship team. But the fact is that in a few games, they helped Jokic, and these necessary bursts reduced the difficulty of Jokic's clearance. For most of the season though, they couldn't hold off on Jokic's rested minutes. So, how good is the Nuggets' lineup? The Jigsaw players look talented, but are they at the right level? Jokic, who committed the 5th offense in G4, witnessed the world-saving performance of the Jigsaws around him. This scene is usually dominated by him, but this time is an exception. God seems to have a special arrangement. They don't want Jokic to remember only the loneliness of leading the team alone and Murray's awakening when he recalls this journey. This also caters to Jokic's needs. He seems to prefer to understand the game in another way. He will set the tone of the game, but generally does not define it independently. Just like when he hid in the corner of the back row in the championship photo, he I want to support the operation of Denver's team, but I don't want to be the entire main body of this team. Denver did not disappoint him. The people around him are great, but they are not as great as you think. At a certain point in time, they stood up in their own way and made the Nuggets three-dimensional, diverse, and diverse. It's so unpredictable, as if the scene with only Jokic's lonely back in the past two years never existed. Jokic clenched his fists and roared on the sidelines, which made you understand that the basketball look he had been waiting for finally appeared. Michael Malone has published countless hymns and eulogies about the best players in the world with the grammar of the world's best player, but the spirit he conveyed in his choked voice and hoarse chicken soup for the soul was always that of teamwork and unity. , sharing weal and woe. This is certainly not a show, this is the mental nutrition that players need most. You don't need to tell Jokic on the sidelines that he is the best in the world. Jokic will use actions to prove the obvious fact that there is no need to emphasize it alone. But Denver needs confidence, needs security, needs stability in good times, and needs to survive in adversity. Malone told them they could, and Jokic helped them prove they really could. Happy Malone. Happy nuggets. I'd really like to find some commonalities between Denver's championship cases, play style, or team building. I really want to say that the future is an era of offense winning championships, but reason tells me that the prerequisite for relying on offense to gain a sense of security is that you must have absolute reliability - note, absolutely, even some historical stars are not worthy of it. The word ""absolutely"" means thighs, and this condition is really difficult to imitate. I also want to say, look, the spring of the small ball market is here, and Denver's smooth team building and persistence have reaped rewards. But if you break down the operations of the Nuggets management over the years, they have made many mistakes, and they are not much better than some teams that are struggling in the bottom half of the playoffs or even on the edge. The premise for everything to happen is that a second-round pick, Jokic, came to this city and firmly carried them on his shoulders when they encountered difficulties. The team management also very wisely chose to devote all their efforts to build a competitive team around Jokic. In the first season when Jokic waited for Murray to return, he took this common rotation with him. Only six teams with players far above their replaceable level won the championship. The examples of the Nuggets and Jokic may only prove one thing - the top stars in history will always receive the praise they deserve. Even if the process will go through twists and turns and they have to wait, they will eventually get to that position. It may even have nothing to do with location or starting point. After it all, Jokic stood in the corner, uninterested in the spotlight outside the game, as was his indifference to the possibility of a three-peat MVP that made onlookers anxious. He himself said that if he was asked to choose, he would not give priority to himself as a teammate in the All-Star Game. Coupled with Denver's naturally unattractive characteristics, people almost ignored that in our era, there is a player who may be promoted to the Pantheon. star. Malone was more eager than anyone else to make the first call. He reminded people harshly and unfairly to look at Denver. That is to ask you not to miss witnessing history and not to miss Jokic. And Jokic just wants to go home. Jokic allowed those around him to share his achievements and results. He was the conqueror, the ultimate winner, but he did not take away everything. Instead, he sat aside like Zhang Muzhi, letting the crowd pouring in behind him occupy the center of the camera. . But so what? Even if he doesn't stand in the center with his arms spread out, we still have to record his achievements, and like Coach Malone, we will take the trouble to preach them over and over again. Jokic, the greatest star in the history of the Denver Nuggets, will continue to unlock the ""greatest"" prefix type in the future, making the definition of this term gradually cover a greater connotation. He endured and waited, conquered the league with his undisputed performance, and shared the honor and joy with his dear partners. He has won all my personal respect. I personally am insignificant, but I believe there are many people who have a similar attitude to me.

He can pass the ball and provide support. He showed his style as the offensive axis in the Rockets last season. Just like Stephen Curry can lead a group of ball-handling shooters with mediocre physical fitness but high shooting talent. If Jokic can win the O'Brien Cup, there is no doubt that this type of European No. 4-5 position, who can pass, can support, and has some scoring methods, will most likely become popular. After all, Jokic was only a second-round pick back then, and with this type of center controlling the rhythm of the game and adapting to the NBA American basketball style, if properly trained, there is huge room for growth. Judging from the comparison between Shen Jing and Olajuwon, Shen Jing’s biggest shortcoming at present is that he suffers in height and wingspan in the competition for the 5th position. According to Jokic’s official information, he is 2.11 meters tall and weighs 128 kilograms. It is a standard center body shape. Shen Jing's height is less than 2.10 meters, with a long neck and insufficient effective height (shoulders). Don't underestimate this height. For European white insiders with less exaggerated athletic ability, they have to deal with old Americans who are tall and strong and have strong jumping ability. , athletes with fast elasticity can take full advantage of each inch of length and strength. There is also a technical shortcoming, which is stable mid-range and long-range shots. If you want to play a style of play similar to Jokic's, you must have a relatively trustworthy long-range shot.

4.92E+15,N6BP97dHF,5542203649,Play Mamba,"Jalen Hood-Schifino, born on June 19, 2003, is 193cm tall and weighs 98kg. He serves as a point guard/shooting guard. In his freshman season, Schiffino played in 32 games, averaging 13.5 points, 4.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 0.8 steals per game, shooting 41.7% from the field, 33.3% from three-point range, and 77.6% from free throws. Original predicted pick: 15-20 picks, selected by the Lakers with the 17th pick. Advantages: 1. Excellent performance in the pick-and-roll. Schiffino is an excellent pick-and-roll ballhandler, able to use the pick-and-roll to score himself or create opportunities for his teammates. He is very quick and is good at using screens to get to the center of the court and then completing jump shots from the mid-range. Schiffino will patiently read the defense in the pick-and-roll, and can use various passes to find big players down the line to open up the defense, or find open teammates who are not involved in the pick-and-roll. 2. Excellent mid-range finisher. Schiffino can hit pull-up jumpers on the move and even make floaters with his left hand. If he can extend his shooting to an NBA-level defense, he could become a mid-range killer. 3. Not afraid of physical confrontation. Schiffino isn't a great finisher at the rim, but he doesn't shy away from contact. He also has the courage to get to the basket when there is enough space at the basket. With his size and mid-range touch, he has the potential to draw a lot of fouls. 4. A complete defender. Schiffino has a strong physique and excellent skills. He defends the ball well and will not suffer even if he switches to the front line. He's quick laterally and stays close to his opponent, doing a great job both one-on-one and around screens. At the same time, his hands are very active and he can often cut the ball, break up the pass, deflect the ball, etc. Disadvantages: 1. Unstable shooting. Schiffino was not a stable shooter in college. There were many times when he performed well, but there were also many times when his hands were cold. In high school, he shot only 23.5% from three-point range and 64.6% from the free throw line. Schiffino's catch-and-shoot shooting is weaker than holding the ball, and shooting from the left and right sides has a greater impact on him than distance, which shows that there are some problems with his shooting. 2. Inadequate ball-holding development ability. Schiffino is not good at one-on-one, and his unstable touch will affect his performance in positional battles. Due to his average athletic ability, Schiffino will make a lot of floaters and pull-up jumpers near the basket and cannot pose much of a threat to the basket. Even when he does get to the basket, his layup percentage is only about half, and he even misses some very simple open baskets. 3. The passing and control skills are not mature. Schiffino is prone to mistakes when pressed by defenders and is inconsistent with the ball when faced with pressure. Schiffino also passes some taken-for-granted passes, and is prone to errors when handling the ball during high-speed transitions. Summary: Schiffino is a physically strong point guard who is good at organizing offense and tough on defense. He is the glue for the team on both offense and defense. Schiffino is an excellent pick-and-roll ballhandler with wide vision, balanced passing and shooting, and stable mid-range. Schiffino is competitive, plays hard and is aggressive defensively. But due to his average athletic ability, Schiffino will struggle very much when he can't find his shooting touch. At the same time, his offensive characteristics are distinctive. He likes to go to the right side in pick-and-rolls, and his offensive area is concentrated in the center of the court, which makes him easy to target. At the same time, Schiffino seems to have few options when facing aggressive defenders or taller defenders. If Schiffino can improve his shooting level, he still has a good chance of becoming a reliable point guard with the accumulation of experience. # Lakers select Hudeskifino #L plays Mamba's Weibo video",,,,Lakers draft Hudes Schifino,6,100,339,6/23/23 11:21,Weibo video account,,"http://f.video.weibocdn.com/o0/YFs4Tp5vlx086sn03rII0104120ju5Ei0E070.mp4?label=mp4_720p&template=1280x720.25.0&ori=0&ps=1BVp4ysnknHVZu&Expires=1694322850&ssig=la HXvkuJIK&KID=unistore,video",

It is expected that the Celtics will reach a contract extension with Porzingis for up to 2 years and 77 million; the Clippers get: Brogdon; the Wizards get: Marcus Morris, Coffey, Gallinari, the No. 30 pick in this year's first round (provided by the Clippers) rarely took a positive turn, started writing early, and then tore up and rewritten...the real transaction content Kyle Special person gets: Porzingis, the Celtics are expected to reach a contract extension with Porzingis for up to 2 years and 77 million, the No. 25 pick in this year's first round (provided by the Grizzlies), the Warriors' top 4 pick protection in 2024 First-round pick (provided by the Grizzlies); Grizzlies receive: Smart; Wizards receive: Tyus Jones, Gallinari, Muscala, this year's second-round pick No. 35 (provided by the Celtics). If there’s any hidden potential blockbuster on the trade market this year, it’s Porzingis. Ever since it was rumored that Porcelain might exercise the player option instead of opting out of the contract and renewing a new contract with the Wizards as previously expected, I have actually been waiting for the boots to fall. Bill's transaction means the Wizards are rebuilding, and Boshen's future will not be with the Wizards. His departure from the team is a foregone conclusion. The question is only Boshen's own understanding of the money path: executing the contract can guarantee the current high salary, but what will happen in the future? The 22-23 season was Boshen's best season since his serious injury, and his personal condition was also at its best, averaging 23.2 points per game and a true shooting percentage of 62.7%, both career highs. His free throw rate has improved significantly, and he played a rare accurate and hard performance. If you don't take advantage of this season to get a new contract, you will regret it if you fall into the embarrassing situation of playing on and off again and constantly looking for form; if you jump out of the contract and go to the free market, what should you do if you don't have an ideal next home? Teams with a large amount of space on the market are all rebuilding. If you give a big contract to a star with an extremely unsatisfactory injury record, wouldn't it be a mistake at the starting line? Previously, the parent team Wizards was the best choice to re-sign a big contract. If the Wizards want to rebuild, this is unrealistic. There are risks whether you jump out or not. But Boshen should know his own value. The playoffs in recent years, especially this year's playoffs, will make management with clearer minds fully aware of the strategic value of big men who can shoot. On this track, Boshen is undoubtedly close to the top of the pyramid. Compared with those inside shooters who can only shoot open spots in specific positions, Boshen has the ability to shoot in all areas, can catch and shoot, and can become a threat down the line. , can also be removed and then pressed to the near and mid-range to punish small misalignments. Boshen's possession rate among centers is second only to Embiid and Big Eyebrow. If a big man wants to increase production, it is not enough to just give him the ball. Even a center like Embiid who wants to take every ball by himself. His assist rate is also as high as 63%. The scope of the sweet spot inside and the ability to catch the ball in the sweet spot are indicators that must be examined. Boshen's wide shooting radius and outstanding height minimize the upfront cost required for him to obtain shooting opportunities, making him very suitable for cooperating with pick-and-roll players who lack passing accuracy. To put it bluntly, Poseidon is a finisher who can take the blame. In addition, Boshen has a sub-top rim protection performance. Among the 23 players who have protected the rim more than 400 times this season, Boshen's rim protection efficiency ranks 9th. Although his personal rebounding data has always been average, throughout his career, when Porcelain is on the court, his impact on limiting opponents' offensive rebounds has been very positive. As a squatting insider, Boshen can be said to be at a relatively good level. If you are a top competitive team, you should buy Poseidon when the opportunity is right. Although Poseidon is placed in front of Jokic, Big Eyebrow, and Embiid, he is obviously the inferior player, but in the context that the top insiders are not enough, there is a person who has the ability to punish big and small, and can protect A center who can provide certain defensive contributions to the basket will still take the strategic initiative in the top competition. The question is just, what is the “right” time? Compared with the decline in touch and the focus on stretching the hips, the main concern for Boshen comes from health. Since his comeback in 2019, Boshen has played 57, 43, 51 and 65 games in four seasons. According to the provisions of the new labor agreement, Boshen has not met the attendance rate for awards in one season. Once Porcelain is troubled by injuries again, holding one of his big contracts will undoubtedly be a disaster. If you are a championship team that is still a little short of the top, but is pursuing winning at the moment, and you can get Boshen with a 1 to 2-year contract at a low cost, it is worthwhile to maximize the upper limit. Considering injuries and the risk of re-signing when the contract expires, from the team's perspective, it would be the most ideal situation to let Poseidon get a contract with a 1+1 team option. Obviously, Bo Shen is not a fool. How can he live in fear because he is constantly being shortchanged? He will seek a long-term contract after performing well in the contract year. After the Boshen trade, there were rumors that the Green Army and Boshen would renew for another two years. This may be a prerequisite for Boshen to execute the player option. In other words, what the Celtics actually got was a Porcelain with a three-year contract. The Celtics are the only ""very young old team"" in the league. Tatum is only 25 years old, but he has played in the playoffs for 6 years, reaching the Finals once and the Eastern Conference Finals three times. No matter how the Celtics deal with Jaylen Brown's next contract, the team's idea of continuing to build the team around Tatum as one of the top two cores will not change in the short term. Tatum's contract runs until the summer of 2026 and can be released in the summer of 25. Horford, White, and Brogdon's contracts run until the summer of 2025, and Lowe's contract runs until the summer of 26. It can be seen that the next 2 to 3 years are still within the plans of the Celtics core team. Since Horford will start receiving a new contract of 10 million next season, which is 16.5 million lower than his last one, this difference allows the Celtics to pay more than the three-person contract of Poseidon Smart, Gallinari and Muscala. After making the difference (7.1 million), there is still a chance to control the total salary close to but slightly lower than the second rich line. The Green Army couldn't get out the money from Liu Gewei. Of course, with the delicate relationship between the two sides this year, they couldn't keep him in the first place. And if they choose to renew Gewei at a premium instead of introducing Boshen, the Green Army will still be in a difficult salary environment. Since the rules limit the number of years and increase in the early extension of the contract of Porcelain who has just been traded (up to 2 years of extension, with an increase of 5%), this means that no matter how Porridge's contract is signed, the time limit will be within the Celtics' plan. Considering the potential huge increase in Jaylen's new contract - if Jaylen renews, his contract increase will be close to 20 million, which will be more expensive than Lillard - this will make the Celtics' salary increase in the 24-25 season Payroll is out of control. A reasonable approach is for the Celtics to renew a contract with Porcelain with a starting salary lower than the current salary. What this price is is crucial to the Celtics' future financial prospects. If the Celtics can figure out their salary planning, they can eliminate their worries and enjoy the improvement in combat power brought by Boshen. When we were worried about who would take over after Horford aged out, the Celtics directly got an upgraded version of the No. 5 three-point shooter and defender who is younger, taller, stronger in taking over the ball, and able to carry more ball rights. basket hand. The ""five-outside"" style of play has become the Celtics' offensive signature. The extreme space minimizes the test of difficult ball-holding cores and improves the environment for attackers to attack the basket and one-on-one. This year's regular season and playoffs, their offensive efficiency ranked second and fourth in the league respectively. Since the Celtics have the ability to pose a fatal threat at positions 1 to 4, this makes the past strategy of using large forwards to face Porcelain and centers to face half-hearted 3D forwards no longer work. The best strategy the opponent can do is to defend the center. Horford/Lowe, and when the Celtics put together a five-man group of White, Brogdon, Jaylen, Tatum, and Porcelain, no matchup may be suitable. Since the Celtics' defensive strategy has completely shifted to the center squatting, introducing an upgraded version of the rim protector will also be a big upgrade on the defensive end. For this trade, the Celtics lost Smart. However, they received this year's No. 25 pick from the Grizzlies and next year's Warriors' first-round compensation. Even if they themselves also took out this year's No. 35 pick, the actual value of the draft picks they received is still close to a late first-round or second-round pick. Early round (the price difference between No. 25 and No. 35 is roughly the same) and 1 mid-to-late first round (depending on how the Warriors choose the future). Smart's salary is only half that of Porcelain. However, he has missed 68 games in the past four years, and on average he only missed 6 to 7 games less than Porcelain in a season. The Celtics received two first-round compensations, which actually compensated for the gap in contract quality between the two to a certain extent. Since the Celtics still have White and Brogdon, as well as Pritchard, who has been practicing for two and a half years but lost his rotation position, they can afford to lose Smart in the backcourt depth. On the offensive end, although Smart is the most aggressive player among the three players in the Green Army's backcourt, after White increased his possession of the ball, he can roughly do most of Smart's work, while Brogdenbis Matt is more aggressive. The Green Army's main loss is that Smart, as the team's perennial defensive panacea, is the team's no-brainer answer. He can lead the core of defense in almost all positions, and is one of the few sweepers for the Green Army outside of the center who can provide help defense on the weak side. For the Green Army, which is gradually losing defensive discipline, losing the ""team soul"" and DPOY will undoubtedly pose a greater test to their end. In fact, even without Smart, the Green Army will not encounter the problem of lack of matchup resources. Although their core rotation players are not as comprehensive as Smart, they each have their own matchup strengths. As for team defensive discipline, what is needed is the return of the overall tacit understanding and the concerted efforts of the coaching staff and the team. Just relying on one person alone will not help. Even Smart's activeness in assisting defense will lead to some missed shots because others fail to follow up and cooperate. This is not uncommon in this year's playoffs. If the Celtics' defense still doesn't improve next season, instead of attributing it to Smart leaving the team, I may question Mazzula's coaching ability more. The Green Army also lost feelings and friendship. The Celtics temporarily changed the selection after the Clippers withdrew, turning Brogdon, who could not be sent, into Smart. In order to make a deal they wanted, they only thought about it for 2 hours before pushing out the veteran of nearly 10 years and ""killing him"". The young marshal's decision to kill is simply... so heart-wrenching! For the championship, the Green Army is really fighting for it. As for the grizzlies, they got a ""Grizzly Look"" puzzle. If the Grizzlies team is asked to make a big move, the Grizzlies probably don't have the courage. But the Grizzlies seem to be too picky if they don't use draft picks to strengthen their position every year. This time they finally took action to upgrade a position, which is considered progress. For the Grizzlies, Smart has two important advantages: First, Smart's contract is of high quality and can be used until the summer of 2026. In the next three years, Smart will only receive 18.6 million, 20 million, and 21.3 million. Although Smart is 4.6 million more expensive than Jones this season, Jones has to negotiate a new contract, and his asking price may not be much lower than Smart's price in the next two years. This move directly eliminates the trouble of Jones' contract renewal; secondly, Smart can either go alone or be used long-term with Morant. Jones is the leader in the field of assist-loss ratio. Smart passes the ball but it is inevitable that he will make mistakes. Purely in terms of organizational talent, Smart is not as good as Jones. But Smart and Jones are at two extremes of the defensive spectrum or coordinate axis. The former can escort Morant and form an unbreakable fairy rope with another DPOY, while the latter will be beaten together with Morant and help DPOY added another foul. Smart has also proven his toughness in the playoffs. Even if there is a very tight series, it is still much better than Jones' efficiency in the playoffs; thirdly, Smart not only solves the problem of Jones' future The question of leaving the team still left Di Long confused. Apart from being a little bigger, Dillon has no advantage over Smart. The former can be called the latter with his brain removed. With the upgraded version in hand, the Grizzlies have no worries about Dillon leaving the team. The Grizzlies have reached the stage of strengthening key pieces to pursue results. Replacing a contract that is about to expire with a price increase with a longer high-quality contract improves combat effectiveness and alleviates the risk of Dillon potentially leaving the team. These two first-rounders are well spent. So, what about the Wizards? ""After sending away two core players, let's see how many first-round picks the Wizards got for rebuilding."" ""Fuck!"" The Thunder and Jazz laughed without saying a word. Well, the Wizards at least got Jones, Gallinari and Muscala. It's not too much for Jones to ask for a first-rounder in the market. The latter two can be sold together for a few second-rounders, and maybe they can get Bill's worth. The second-round pick with the 35th pick also looks more valuable than the Suns' second-round pick. Compared with the time they sent away Beal, the Wizards retained some dignity by sending away Porridge's potentially expiring contract. Now, the Wizards have four ""stable players"": Tyus Jones, Monte Morris, and the real Wolongfengxia who helped lose the competition. They have the originator of stability, Grandpa St. Paul, to support the formation, and they have stability off the court. The stream hides as V. Delon Wright passes a cigarette to the bench. The Wizards waved their hands and supported the organizational work of the connecting section of the four teams, which is not too much. Also, not long ago, they gave Goodwin to the Suns in vain. This person also had an assist-loss ratio of 2.95. Gallinari and Muscala accurately correspond to the league's most popular space-based No. 4 and space-based No. 5 positions. This kind of inexpensive little puzzle-taking into account the injuries Gallinari suffered last year, his contract was forfeited. You can't tell who will pick up the money - you won't lose if you pick one up and take it back. The Wizards also have high-quality terminator Gafford, defensive champion Avdija, and shooter Keith Porter. They can also sign and trade Kuzma - who still has dreams? After a series of operations, the Wizards are expected to have 20 second-round picks. After the Thunder's first-round series, the Wizards will dominate the second half of the draft as a goat in the second round. Let the Suns and Celtics have the Big Three; save the Grizzlies the trouble of contract renewal; go back and send a point guard to the Los Angeles duo, the Nuggets, and the Spurs. There is no other way, but I can't see the suffering in the world; Gallinari, Muss Kara, tie them all up and send them away. What? No one called? I can't stand a GM who reacts so slowly. Hurry up, we've settled this matter. Wizards, really, it’s not a big deal to watch the fun, right? You just want these championship teams to have their heads beaten into pieces, right? Finally, a few words about the Suns and Green Army. In the context of the new version of the collective bargaining agreement trying to control teams with huge salaries, both teams have embarked on the road of multi-giants without iteration, which is a bit crazy at the end. Therefore, it will be difficult to form a lineup of giants in the future, so making plans in advance is the best way to deal with restrictions? Considering that the salary cap is expected to continue to rise by 10% in the next few years, this will continue to reduce the pressure on the salary bill brought by non-newly signed large contracts. It is equivalent to holding more long-term contracts now and does not allow unlimited increases. After the total salary is paid, it is equivalent to saving money in advance. Let’s take a look at how the market is operating. Although it is nothing new that restrictions lead to results that deviate from the original intention, but before the new agreement was introduced, the Suns and Celtics slapped the league alone, which is really interesting.

In today's NBA Finals G3, the Nuggets, playing away from home, relied on their overall advantages and the outstanding performance of their star players to withstand the Heat's many counterattacks and successfully gained a valuable victory at their opponent's home court. After this battle, the Nuggets The team fully demonstrated its championship temperament. If nothing else happens, this year's championship will ultimately belong to the Nuggets! Use the other person's method and do the same to the other person. Nuggets head coach Zhuge Malone does have the style of a famous coach! In the last game of the Heat, coach Spoelstra took the initiative to change the lineup, put Love into the starting lineup, and used the 2020 Lakers' big move to defend Jokic, constantly draining Teacher Yue and letting him play in singles, cutting off Teacher Yue's contact with others. So Teacher Yue’s 40+10 was reduced to nothing. In this game, coach Malone saw his tricks and followed the same pattern, consuming Butler throughout the game and letting him play in singles, which also cut off the connection between him and his teammates. Therefore, the Heat's outside pitchers were collectively inaccurate today. It is true that they couldn't make the shot because of their poor touch. factors, but only Butler can control the ball in the Heat's starting lineup. When he steps into the singles trap set by the Nuggets, the Heat's shooters are bound to lose many excellent shooting opportunities. They are not good at making shots because they can't. If you break through, losing becomes much more reasonable. With a perfect match and twin stars shining, Murray and Jokic can be called the best duo in active service! Murray really stood up in today's game and delivered a triple-double of 30+10+10, successfully helping Mr. Yue share the pressure of scoring and organization, while Mr. Yue's performance was even better, 30+20 A large triple-double of +10 is unique in the history of the league. In fact, in the last game, Murray repeatedly hit the key three-pointers in the decisive moment, which was already arrogant enough. Today, he used his unsolvable attacks again and again to crush the Heat's hope of counterattack. In this game, the Heat did not They lost completely to Teacher Yue, because they have proven that the Nuggets cannot win with Teacher Yue alone. The key is that no one in the Heat can match Murray. The Heat, like the Lakers, lack someone in the team who can do it. The star defender who faced off against Murray. The importance of this game is self-evident, so both the Heat and the Nuggets attach great importance to it. Butler and Adebayor of the Heat, Jokic and Murray of the Nuggets, all played more than 40 minutes, because no matter Whoever wins will have an advantage in the finals. For the Heat, if they win this game, they will hope to gain a 3-1 lead in their two home games. For the Nuggets, as long as they win this game, even if they lose the next game, they can still return to their home court with a big score of 2-2. Therefore, both teams fought fiercely today. Butler and Adebayo have tried their best. Their bodies are at a disadvantage compared to the Nuggets, but their hard work is still strong, but at this level in the finals In terms of confrontation, it is difficult to win consistently by just working hard, because the further you go, the more disadvantages in lineup and size will be infinitely magnified, and this kind of comprehensive strategic passivity cannot be achieved by just adjusting tactics. To make up for it, it is foreseeable how difficult it will be for the Heat in the next few games. Things have sweetness and bitterness, and those who taste them know it; the road has obstacles and dangers, and those who walk on it know it. So far this year's playoffs, Butler has led the team all the way to the finals. He is legendary enough, tough enough, and inspiring enough for us to never give up easily no matter what hardships we face in our future lives, because of hard work. It really can work wonders. However, competitive sports are often very cruel. Although it cannot be judged only by the champion, in a sense, the second place is the biggest loser. Are the Nuggets not strong enough? Are the Heat not tough enough? No, it's because two teams can play in the finals, and the championship trophy can only be won by one team. Only the strongest player on the winning team can get the FMVP! The new leaves in the fragrant forest urge the old leaves, and the waves in the flowing water give way to the waves behind! The Heat are the toughest and most tenacious team in the league, while the Nuggets are a better, younger and more powerful team. The Heat still have the possibility of winning the championship in theory, but there are not many theories left for them!

In fact, the Heat were trying hard to prevent Jokic from catching the ball, and then maximized the timing of the double-team attack to cut off the connection between Jokic and his teammates. , it’s not like letting him fight casually. So in this game, Jokic dismantled the defense better and returned to triple-double mode again. Murray made slightly more mistakes, but the Nuggets' opening momentum was established by his scoring, and the situation in the second quarter was stabilized by his three-pointers. Murray was very aggressive throughout the game and made many shots that made the Heat helpless. star ball. The Heat then began to attack Murray frantically. If the defensive form can be like this in the future, Murray can handle it better. When the game turned to Yomu vs. Butler Reba, the offensive power of the Nuggets duo was very obvious. The Heat's three-pointers were better blocked by the Nuggets, and they finally no longer had so many unreasonable three-pointers. This is when Hiero will really be remembered. Although the Nuggets did not open a three-pointer, Braun made 7 of 8 off the bench and became a surprise player.

Teacher Yue has already scored a triple-double at halftime. (14 points, 12 rebounds, 7 assists); the second is to maximize the individual advantage. Old Love resolutely feeds Gordon into mismatches. Whoever holds the ball looks for opportunities to switch and rush into the three-second zone. This puts the Heat into a certain degree. foul trouble (but Vincent's third foul is questionable). On the Heat's side, JB focused a lot of energy on chasing Murray. Murray felt hot but was very tired. On the offensive end, JB also found various pick-and-rolls to name Murray, mainly to attract double teams and create opportunities for shooters. In the first half, both teams' baskets were average, but the Nuggets relied more on their stars. Of the team's 53 points, 45 were related to Teacher Yoo and Murray.

4.91E+15,N3Ww499Cl,1865716011,Hou Ying pfsk,"Vincent played in the NCAA for 4 years at the University of California, Santa Barbara, averaging only 14.8 points per game. Before Vincent, the most famous NBA player produced by the University of California, Santa Barbara was Brian Shaw. Shaw averaged only 6.9 points per game in his career. After graduating from college, Vincent was undrafted in the 2018 draft and eventually went to the Stockton Kings, a team affiliated with the Kings G League. In the 2019-20 season, Vincent averaged 23.4 points per game for the Stockton Kings. He averaged 4.4 three-pointers per game with a 42.1% three-point shooting rate. Vincent's performance attracted the attention of Heat assistant general manager Adam Simon. Simon had a communication with Vincent's agent Bill Neff, which opened the door to Vincent's destiny. In January 2020, the Heat signed Vincent with a two-way contract, and Vincent began his journey. For a fringe player, running for a living is nothing, but the context at the time must be considered. At that time, the COVID-19 epidemic was in its early stages, everything was unknown, and everyone was full of fear of the virus. Before the NBA was suspended due to the epidemic, Vincent was constantly on the road for six weeks. One day he was in Miami, and the next day he had to be in Sioux Falls, 1,500 miles away, to play for the Heat's affiliate team Sky Force. He heard the call the day after tomorrow. Then you may have to rush to Washington or Dallas. Usually traveling with the Heat, Vincent also has a chartered flight to take, and the Heat have complete epidemic prevention measures. But when Vincent travels by himself, he needs to take a commercial flight with ordinary passengers, and the chance of contracting the virus increases dramatically. Also, there were no direct flights between Miami and Sioux Falls, so he had to transfer every time. During that time, Vincent could rarely stay in one place for more than 48 hours. He was always in ""on the road"" mode. Vincent calculated that during those six weeks, he spent most of his time staying in hotels, flying, and sitting in the airport waiting. Many times he ate at the airport. When Vincent was called up, he didn't get many opportunities. For example, when the Heat play the Magic and Bucks at home and the Warriors and Wizards on the road, Vincent can play for 1 minute and 37 seconds when he has more Vincent, and he can only play for 21 seconds when he has less Vincent. Vincent's running around is just to be able to show up during garbage time. Is it embarrassing? Vincent doesn't feel ashamed, every bit of accumulation is the prelude to success. Before the NBA was suspended due to the epidemic in the 2019-20 season, Vincent only played 6 games for the Heat. After the rematch, Vincent played three regular season games and only played 15 seconds in the playoffs as the Heat entered the Finals. In addition, in October 2020, Vincent underwent knee surgery after the season ended. It seems that this fringe player who averaged 2.4 points per game and shot 21.6% from the field has come to an end in the NBA. But in November 2020, the Heat gave Vincent a two-way contract to keep him. Spoelstra valued his compatibility with the team. The Heat also handed Vincent an upgrade plan. Heat assistant coach Glass hopes that Vincent will transform from a shooting guard to a point guard. Glass helped Vincent adjust his shooting posture and speed up his shooting speed. Because Vincent is only 1.88 meters tall, speeding up his shooting speed would have all the benefits but no harm. Glass also helped Vincent strengthen his defense and organizational skills. Lowry also played a major role in Vincent's improvement of organizational skills, although he knew that Vincent's transition to point guard would affect his position and playing time. It brought a shock, but Lori was still willing to teach Vincent step by step. Even when Lowry was recuperating at home, he would text Vincent during halftime to remind him of things to pay attention to. Vincent gradually established himself, and finally became a regular player in the summer of 2021 and received a formal contract. In the 2021-22 season, Vincent entered the main rotation, and his average playing time increased to 23.4 minutes per game. He also started 27 games, averaging 8.7 points, 3.1 assists per game, and shooting 36.8% from three-point range. This season, Vincent played in 68 games, starting 34 of them. In the second half of the season, he completely replaced Lowry as the starting point guard. In the playoffs, Vincent started in 19 games, averaging 13.9 points and 3.9 assists per game. His three-point shooting percentage was a terrifying 41.3%, which was a huge improvement compared to the 33.4% in the regular season. ""The most difficult thing for young players is the role change, but he accepted the challenge,"" Spoelstra praised Vincent. ""He was originally a second position and a shooter, but we wanted to develop him. He can play as a two-guard and play an organizational role. He accepted the challenge and has made great progress in the past three years."" Adebayor called Vincent ""Mr. Reliable"" not only because Vincent can score, but also because he can score. It’s also because of Vincent’s ever-improving passing, defensive pressure, and drawing of opponents’ offensive fouls and other small details. Vincent was able to do these things that he could not have done otherwise, relying on accumulation and persistence day after day. Not long ago, some people in the industry predicted that Vincent would have a chance to win a contract with an annual salary of tens of millions of dollars in the offseason, and he would finally make it. ""I just don't give up, I just persevere. You never know when or where the opportunity will appear.

They just tried not to use double-teaming tactics and let Teacher Yue choose between high-risk passes and his own shots. Second, the Nuggets did not lose in offense today, but in defensive discipline. The first three-pointer scored by Strus in the opening game was an omen. Pop, Gordon and Porter had huge problems in the communication and execution of defense changes. The early open opportunities gave the Heat shooters confidence in shooting. In the second half, the Nuggets' overcorrected expansion of defense allowed Adebayor to rush out of the aggression. Sex, and finally put yourself in the embarrassing situation of being attacked from both sides. Third, the effect of Coach Spoelstra returning Love to the starting lineup was immediate. When he was on the court, he not only made it difficult for Gordon to play bullyball in G1, but also did a very good job in protecting rebounds, screening and assisting defense. The Heat absolutely need it. His size and experience. Fourth, in the first half of the fourth quarter, Deng Luo attacked like Curry, Adebayor was an upgraded version of Dream Chaser, and Vincent was a short version of Tang Shen. Fifth, this was Porter Jr.'s worst game in the playoffs this year. The unnecessary foul he made when facing Adebayor for a dunk in the fourth quarter was more like frustration than a real attempt to make up for it. Defend. Sixth, Coach Spoelstra mentioned the word ""reinvent"" when talking about Vincent after the game. In fact, this is the secret of the Heat's ability to maximize the abilities of role players. Many stars say they are ""willing to do anything to win"", but in fact they always feel superior and unwilling to change. However, when playing in the Heat, you must accept the team's arrangements and positioning, even if it takes three years like Vincent Switch from the second position to the first position. #nbaTucaoConference##Heat 1 to 1 Nuggets##NBAfinals#",,,,"NBA Tucao Conference, Heat 1-1 Nuggets, NBA Finals",0,5,13,6/5/23 21:12,Weibo web version,,,

4.91E+15,N3UQS6eB8,6770423528,Miles,"Jiba once said at Game1's post-match press conference that he believed in his teammates. Even if they missed the first 10 shots, he would still choose to pass the ball as long as there was an opening. At the same time, Jiba also expressed his confidence in his teammates, and the performance of the Heat shooters in Game 2 did not seem to disappoint Master Chief. Except for JB, the other players made a total of 15 of 30 shots from the outside. The undrafted Vincent + Strus + Robinson scored a total of 47 points. Their performance is not surprising. Today's game seems to have returned to the positive cycle where everyone in the Heat was furious in the first three rounds. Of course, in addition to finally finding his target on the outside, Spoelstra's scheduling at the beginning is also very important. In the first quarter of the last game, Gordon's size frequently found mismatch opportunities. Therefore, after putting Cupid as the starter in Game 2, at least the Golden Nuggets have one less point that can be misplaced. In addition, when being attacked and switching offense and defense, there is also Adebayor or Cupid to protect the frame and prevent them from letting go. The Nuggets eat up the small ones so easily. Next, the defensive strategy against Teacher Yue has also been effective. Since I can't defend you no matter how hard I defend, I will let you play alone, but I won't give you a chance to organize an attack. Although Teacher Yue scored 41 points today, he only had 4 assists and made 5 turnovers. The Heat series is now tied 1-1, and they will definitely be more difficult to deal with when they return to their home court.

4.91E+15,N3ufr4cT7,2231869757,Wade Bar official Weibo,"Some comments about today's Heat loss: Good morning, Adebayo, Vincent, Lowry and Highsmith. Because, saying hello to other people makes me embarrassed. Windhorst just said that Jimmy has never been the same since he sprained his ankle against the Knicks. But he's not using injury as an excuse, and he's right. I'll say it again, I'm honestly not too worried about Butler finding his way in this series. I think he's going to find a way to help the team win, and he's been doing a good job at that. Hello everyone, let me tell the fans who are still overly worried. In our three championship finals, we never won the first game. Miami Heat 3-pointers, regular season 34.4% First two rounds 36.3% Conference finals 43.4% Finals Game 1 33.3% Highlights from Game 1: Loved Adebayo’s performance today, Highsmith was impressive , Jimmy needs to get better, the shooters need to score some damn goals, bad shooting is holding them back. Even though the Nuggets had a clear advantage throughout the game, I wasn't despairing of the series. Because, Miami played really poorly in the first half. However, I believe Struss and Martin won't be that bad again. Jimmy's not going to miss the free throw line all game, we know what we need. Miami actually controlled Denver's offensive efficiency to 112.1 in the first game. You must know that the Nuggets' offensive efficiency in the playoffs can reach 121.1. The Heat are really getting better and better so far, and I can’t stress that enough. The Heat shot 31% from open three-pointers in Game 1, and Miami shot nearly 49% in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Celtics. Perhaps in the eyes of some people, the Miami Heat are not the NBA Finals. Material. But let the Bucks, Knicks and Celtics beat them. This Denver is good, the best team we've faced so far, but...believe the Heat can beat the Nuggets. #burnmyJune#",,,,burn my june,12,13,101,6/2/23 22:33,,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/8507a13dly1hek8zjo0nej20u011igr2.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/8507a13dly1hek8zjvsfaj20u011idl0.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 8507a13dly1hek8zk98dxj20u011iwjl.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/8507a13dly1hek8zjfc6vj20u011idlf.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/8507a13dly1hek8zkm44 gj20u011i79i.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg. cn/large/8507a13dly1hek8zkw3u9j20u011i109.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/8507a13dly1hek8zlj50rj20u011ijz8.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/8507a13dly1hek 8zj5rsaj20u011iwlz.jpg', 'https:// wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/8507a13dly1hek8zlvthsj20u011in4o.jpg']",,

4.91E+15,N3rQREow8,1792572231,The director is here_,"#体育##NBA# The Warriors and Lakers have been eliminated. If they want to continue to be a championship team next season, both teams need some changes. On May 31st, Beijing time, the US media supported Hu Yong in a 3-for-1 deal, each getting what they needed and achieving a win-win situation. The specific trade plan is for the Lakers to send Rui Hachimura, Reeves and a 2029 first-round pick to get Thompson from the Warriors. The Lakers build a new trident. The reason why the US media believes that the Lakers will be willing to consider this plan is that Thompson's technical characteristics are very suitable for the Lakers and is expected to become James' new perfect match. He is one of the best outside shooters in NBA history. With his restraint on the court, James and Big Eyebrow can get better scoring opportunities. In the regular season this season, Thompson averaged 21.9 points per game, shot 41.2% from three-point range, and made 87.9% from free throws. He made a total of 301 three-pointers in the regular season, ranking first in the league. Although his form declined in the playoffs, averaging 18.5 points per game and shooting 36.8% from three-point range, one thing that is certain is that he will always be an elite shooter before Thompson retires. Although his defensive ability after returning from a serious injury has has declined, but can still defend players in multiple positions. Of course, Thompson still has enough experience in the playoffs and finals. He helped the Warriors win four championships and was selected to the All-Star five times during this period. The Warriors' replacement of fresh blood in the library is not for sale, but Thompson is not. If there is a good trading plan, I believe the Warriors will be willing to consider it. The Warriors don't want to give Thompson a maximum salary. If he can be exchanged for Rui Hachimura, Reeves and a first-rounder, the Warriors will at least evaluate the offer. Reeves and Hachimura are both young and promising players. Reeves averaged 13 points, 3 rebounds and 3.4 assists in the regular season, and his playoff data increased to 16.9 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.6 assists. Hachimura averaged 11.2 points per game in the regular season and 12.2 points in the playoffs. COSCO's shooting performance was stable. As for the first-round pick in 2029, it is expected to be very valuable. By then James has retired, and the Lakers' first-round pick may become a high draft pick. The Warriors and Lakers are both popular teams, and there will definitely be a lot of trade rumors during the offseason. Executives on both sides need to evaluate the possibilities to see if there is an opportunity to help strengthen their respective cores.",,,,"sports, NBA",0,0,0,6/2/23 16:27,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hehqdddu3mj20m80et76u.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hehqddbxk5j20qo0g0q55.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/ d1b82c50ly1hehqdd9ii7j20qn0fx3zh.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hehqddfgb8j20qo0hyn1f.jpg']",,

The weakness that emerged was Adebayor's mid-range shot, which had little impact on the game; this year's finals stage is dominated by a group of second-round picks and undrafted draft picks. Is this a subversion of the NBA's ""static talent first"" selection standard? ?",,,,NBA Finals,0,0,0,6/2/23 11:06,Weibo search,,,
4.91E+15,N3pKNFGJX,5031705099,Host Peng Lei,"Congratulations to the Nuggets, leading the Heat 1:0 in the finals. The Heat lost in G1 for the first time in the playoffs. They had won on the road three times before (Bucks, Knicks, Celtics). The Heat's loss today was a sign from the starting lineup. Of course, any formation has advantages and disadvantages. What if I win? Love was not transferred back to the starting lineup, which made the inside team suffer at the beginning. And as long as he is not starting, Spoelstra will not play him in the second team, because that transitional stage is when the Heat want to play fast. In other words, if he starts against Jokic and Adebayor against Gordon, can Gordon continue to dominate the inside? We can look forward to G2 adjustments. However, having said that, the Nuggets scored 104 points in the game, with the most points in a single quarter being 30 points in the second quarter. The Heat are not that good on the defensive end, but they are not that bad. If I have to pick a problem, it is ""intensity"", 4 at halftime There were two fouls, and the intensity and determination of the double attack were obviously not enough. The first game felt like an adaptation day for tourists coming to Denver for the Heat, with no intensity! But the Heat's biggest problem is the continuity of their offense. I also mentioned in the Final Chapter program that anyone who is really familiar with the Heat knows that although this team is known as a team, it encounters an equally complete system and lacks transitions and fast breaks. After scoring, their positional offense needs to have no error tolerance, but...how is this possible🤔The Heat only scored 63 points in the first three quarters, 30 points in the last quarter, and 93 in the game, yes Strus Martin Dunro Neither is accurate, but 2 free throws in the game? what? Butler and Adebayo made 0 free throws? Jokic committed 1 foul and Gordon had 0 fouls. OK, since you can't shoot accurately, you have to increase your intensity. If you can't defend well and your offense is confused, that won't work. Even though Gordon only scored 16 points in the game, the 12 points in the opening set the tone. The Heat started off smoothly, winning the first quarter and finally winning the game after 7 wins and 2 losses. But as a challenger, losing an away game is not a disaster for the Heat. There are also things he did well. Adebayor proved what we said, he is indeed the most unique center that Jokic has encountered in the playoffs this year! 26 points and 13 rebounds are not bad, but it would be nice to have a few harder layups. Butler's overall success rate at the basket is good, but most of it comes from air cuts without the ball, and lacks the ability to kill the frame on his own. Today's pick-and-roll attempts were almost all from mid-range on the right side, and the effect is not good. But I'm not worried about Butler, he has a way to solve some scoring problems. As for the shooting group's inaccuracy, the two elder brothers above need to be responsible. (Jokic is too strong, and he didn’t even feel at full strength today) The G2 Heat need to increase the intensity of the game to win, which means getting tougher and tougher, both offensively and defensively. In addition, we need to be more resolute in flanking Jokic. I always feel half a beat today...

The last time they trailed 1 to 3 in the finals was in the 2020 park season. That year their opponent was Zhan Mei Led by the Los Angeles Lakers, the Heat fought tooth and nail to win G5, but still lost the life-and-death G6, which was hard to conceal their defeat. Facing the Denver Nuggets who dominate the Western Conference this year, will the Miami Heat still have a chance to make a comeback? The answer is, it's difficult. Maybe before G3, we thought that this Heat could still compete with the Nuggets if the three-point line was open. But after G4, everyone suddenly realized that the Heat may really not be able to survive... Whether it is in terms of height or player ability, the Nuggets are more than one level ahead of the Heat. The Nuggets can beat the Heat every night. He can complete aerial work on his head, and can also use the offensive threats at five points on the field to infinitely stretch the Heat's defensive position. On the Heat's side, the offensive firepower is obviously shorter, and the defensive matchups are completely overwhelmed. The Heat's only hope is the shooters from the outside. However, facing the Nuggets' high-intensity defense, they only missed two games. , resulting in the current situation of 1 to 3. The only time in history that the Cavaliers made a 1-3 comeback in the finals was the 2016 Cavaliers, but the talent of that team was obviously beyond the reach of this civilian Heat. So what awaits the Heat in G5 may be an early exit... Pat Riley's civilian team culture has helped the Heat reach the finals twice in four years, but with limited talent, they have never been able to win the championship.

4.91E+15,N3jaBoJIy,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[They are all already winners] Let me start with an intuitive conclusion: This is the season where teachers are invited to reach the top. This premonition was very strong before the start of the Western Conference Finals. After passing the Lakers, neither the Celtics nor the Heat can stop the Nuggets. However, after watching the Heat's performance all the way, especially this series with the Celtics, the magic of the ""Marvin Deng"" trio really leaves room for imagination: a playoff catch-and-shoot three-pointer A forward with a rate of 52.5%, he can respond when given space, and he can also make changes in front of the body, twist his body to finish, or complete a turn-over jump shot after stopping the ball. He can even perform a pull-up and stay in the air, which is a proper superstar technical move, but he is not an absolute starter in the Heat; he is confident in his pull-up jumper, can pass the ball from behind, and can use a change of rhythm to break through to complete the high-speed jumper. A difficult-to-finish guard, he averaged 2.4 three-pointers per game with a 39% shooting rate in the playoffs. He is good at scoring, passing and controlling, and has defensive confidence beyond his size, so that veteran Lowry can only serve as his substitute; A super shooter who can use his coquettish moves to deceive the Celtics' defense into chaos. His fatal accuracy makes Double Green complain again and again. He doesn't know when his potential will be awakened, and he will light up his enhanced skills of cutting for layups and waiting for opportunities to play the ball. He interspersed between the Green Army's defenses and exposed his opponents' disciplinary deficiencies to the public. The technical characteristics of the three brothers correspond to the Nuggets' defensive strategy of delaying the ball holder and putting them on the outside. Assuming that they are still in a competitive state during the Eastern Conference qualifying trip, the Nuggets cannot defend them at all. In this year's playoffs, Miami has been proving one thing - although their talent is not optimistic, they have no problems at the offensive development level. None of the Bucks, Knicks, or Celtics can make the Heat fall into the embarrassing situation of ""the eldest brother passes on to the second brother, the second brother passes on to the third brother, the third brother passes on to the younger brother, the younger brother passes on to the rookie, and the rookie takes over."" The Heat's passing, running and cutting are delicate and patient. It is not difficult to find a shooting opportunity that is not too spacey. Butler is not a top-level ball-handling attacker, but he can always handle a round in a more appropriate way, such as slowing down to break through and go to the baseline, waiting for the weak side to take advantage of the three-point opportunity to cover the shooter, or pulling in a shot that is beyond people's expectations. He jumps into the net with conventional knowledge. Anyway, you don't want to push him into a desperate situation. With the Heat's Jigsaw players -- who handle the ball so much -- you always expect them to turn the ball over in a high-pressure defense, or take some outrageous shots when they have no other choice. The reality is that their confident shots seem to be fully prepared, and with the cooperation of their Eastern opponents' strategies - generally staying defensive and retreating - it is not difficult for them to get a shot with the ball. So far in the playoffs, there are only two situations where the Heat's offense has been relatively embarrassing. One is when Lowry, the team's most experienced championship point guard, makes a mistake, and the other is when Adebayor reluctantly takes a super-high arc mid-range shot. That's all. The Nuggets' commonly used defensive strategies - delaying or trapping pick-and-rollers, forcing them to play the ball, and testing the role players' ball-handling and shooting accuracy. They use this method to defend against the Suns quite effectively - but it may not be ideal when compared to the Heat. Effect. The Heat have a strong ability to move the ball in short distances in succession. Although Adebayor's downfield finishing power is not as good as that of the Western Conference boss, he can act as a second-line dealer to connect with the Heat puzzle pieces, or he can do it a little above the free throw line. To provide support, it is probably not too difficult for the team to rely on their running speed advantage to cut the Nuggets basket. Therefore, the Nuggets can also try to retreat. They did this in the series against the Lakers, and combined with the outside recovery card to break through the route, the effect was okay. In addition, the Nuggets have better initial conditions against Butler than the Eastern Conference teams. Aaron Gordon is tall and strong, and he can just cover Butler. When Butler is not holding the ball, Gordon can also help the team defend. The Nuggets should do one thing - look down on the Heat and throw in ball-handling shots, or even three-pointers with the ball. Vincent, Lowry, Butler, and Dun Luo may all have hot hands in frontal cooperation, but you can't care too much about these. The Heat's ball-handling and shooting efficiency in the playoffs ranks ninth in the league, which is still far behind their only catch-and-shoot efficiency in the playoffs. Although no one can tell clearly about the Heat's three-point shooting - 45% against the Bucks, 43.4% against the Celtics, not as good defensively as the Double Green, and 30.6% for the Knicks, who missed spot-ups like a child's play - there is always a probability of being punished for missing open spots. It's bigger. In addition, if you pay too much attention to the movement of the ball holder and the shooter without the ball, you will be more likely to miss the cut to the basket. Jokic and Gordon, the two largest players in the Nuggets, are facing off against the two Heat players who are the largest and have the greatest threat to the basket but the least threat from long range shots. If the two Nuggets can do it, whether it's a pick-and-roll or a roll call, I will try to get in as much as possible and rely on my physical dimensions - especially Jokic - to try to block the opponent in the area near the basket, allowing Rebado to Throwing shots and letting Butler lean back more, then the Nuggets can at least maintain a defensive data that is not too miserable. After all, as long as Jokic is not transferred out, the Nuggets' rebounding is guaranteed. Don't expect to ""defend"" the Heat. The Heat are ""idiots"" who just play without that kind of test. Their individual player's golf IQ and team integrity are far better than any opponent the Nuggets have encountered in the West, and the Eastern Conference has better defensive resources. No team has ever brought the Heat to a standstill. The only one that came close to this effect was the Green Army's counterattack in the Eastern Conference Finals. They once found the correct posture to switch to guard Butler and suppressed the Heat's singles. But under normal circumstances, when the Nuggets defend Butler's call, Pope will change, and Murray may change. Jokic and Porter are unwilling to defend like this unless it is the last moment of the game. The Nuggets need to focus on the key points, give less open shots and cuts, protect the rebounds, and just keep a number that they can accept because the score is high. Let's assume that the Heat finally achieved an offensive efficiency of 117~118 - between the Celtics and the Bucks - which looks scary, right? However, the Nuggets said that our starting price is 120. On the other hand, how do the Heat defend the Nuggets? Zone defense? Jokic may be able to do more than anyone else in the mid-range area. He can make a mid-range shot from where he is, he can make a floater, he can connect with shooters from the bottom corner, or he can simply take a step forward and face Reba. hate. Single defense? What mistake did poor Reba make that you want to treat him like this? Pincer attack? Do you think Porter's move wasn't quick enough, or that Pop's shot wasn't decisive enough? Normally guarding Jokic, the Heat can't handle it. Judging from the regular season matches between the two teams, the Heat's idea of defending Jokic is to go forward. This strategy is actually effective. In the February match between the two teams, Murray's absence weakened the team's ability to pass the ball to Jokic. The absence of Murray also meant that Jokic had to play more in the low post to carry the main attack, which made the bypass Defending forward became a natural fit. In this game, Jokic only took 14 shots and had only 8 assists - forgive me for using two ""only"" - which shows that Jokic's ball-holding and initiating scenes are greatly limited. However, Jokic scored 12 of 14 shots in this game. As long as he gets the ball, there is really nothing the Heat can do. The characteristic of the Heat's defensive system is that they are not afraid of a single defense point being transferred away, and they can also accept the loss of a single defense point and rely on team defense to make up for it. Their ability to draw offensive fouls, interfere with card interference, and cut off passes and receptions are all unique skills. But because it is a small team, small players often appear in the position of protecting the basket. The efficiency of defending near the basket cannot be guaranteed. Their most powerful way to prevent big men from getting the ball near the basket is to cut the ball. , a style of play like Embiid's that moves the ball upwards will definitely suffer here. But when Jokic enters the area near the basket, he will show the European center's awareness of holding high and playing high. Even grabbing the board is a point rebound and does not need to be grabbed. He can rely on his incredible wrist sense and balance to complete the shot without dribbling and relying on the defender to turn around. The Heat's ""lower three"" defense may not work here, allowing Jokic to successfully get the ball within 10 feet. There is a high probability that the Heat will lose this round. Therefore, the Heat's thinking in the regular season is right. They still have to try their best to prevent Jokic from receiving the ball. For example, the players guarding the defender should move inward slightly, take off with both hands to interfere with the ball route, and the players guarding Jokic should go forward and get stuck. bits and so on. You may say - this is unrealistic. During the pick-and-roll between Murray and Jokic, you can't treat Murray as air. How come the Lakers didn't see it? Jokic also has the ability to hold the ball from beyond the three-point line. He will use the cover to catch the ball at the free throw line, or Iverson will cut the ball and catch the ball at the elbow and immediately enter an attack state. If you have to guard a center who is the most difficult to catch the ball in history, what's the future? Yes, there is no future. But there is still a difference between a narrow escape from death and no life from ten. You have to find a way, right? After all, the Nuggets' choices are not reasonable every round. The Nuggets have an advantage over the Heat, and the advantage lies with Jokic. Replace Jokic with another center, and the Heat have a hand in beating the Nuggets. This is why the Heat should try their best to put Jokic in a state of ""wanting to catch the ball but not being able to catch the ball"". In this state, Jokic is neither a brain nor a sharp knife. The Heat can deal with other people's decisions and methods. The Heat have to defend against those rounds where the Nuggets' choices are not 100% reasonable. To put it bluntly, defend what you can. So, can the Heat think of something ""evil""? Is there a way similar to the Lakers' method of using thick eyebrows to defend Gordon and Hachimura to defend Jokic? Apart from Reba, the only rotation the Heat can use to top Jokic is Love. It is indeed possible to try the matchup of Love + Reba against Jokic + Gordon respectively, but the effect is not that exciting: First, compared with the thick eyebrows, Reba is not as powerful in defending a space-draining point and assisting in defense at the basket. Big; the second is Love's pick-and-roll against Murray Jokic. Will he be killed in the front? The Heat can try this and then be prepared to change back to matchup. Another trick that can be tried, and which is more likely to be effective, is Butler + Reba defending Murray + Jokic. The two try to switch to some pick-and-rolls, bypass Jokic's low post, and then combine other defense points with help. Debate about the teacher's IQ. The candidates to defend Gordon are one of Martin or Love. The former is slightly lacking in strength, and will be uncomfortable with rebounding and strong defense. The latter suffers from mobility problems, and it is difficult to prevent Gordon from reaching the top of the arc and asking the teacher to make a cut. But Love will improve the Heat's rebound protection. Faced with the Nuggets, who have a huge overall size advantage and a rebounding monster Jokic, the attribute of rebound protection is still very important. It's really hard to guard the Nuggets. The Heat's defense is not afraid of most individual stars - Bronson YYDS - but Jokic is indeed too special, and under his influence, the entire Nuggets will become even more special. Although it is not easy for the Nuggets to defend against the Heat, compared to temporarily ""asking the gods"" and betting on which version of the Heat will be the three-point series, the Nuggets' offense is undoubtedly more stable. It's really not surprising to be favored. So, is there any script you can think of for the Heat to beat the Nuggets? Yes, some conditions are required: The performance of the undrafted team needs to be the Eastern Conference Finals version, and Butler is full of aggression and energy, and his jump shot is once again extraordinary; Love is the amazing version, and then proves that he will not be targeted by the Nuggets on the court. . In this case, the Heat will close the size gap with the Nuggets, and rebounds will be better protected; the Heat will have to establish sufficient advantages in the transition period. Although both teams will fill up their starting time in the later stages of the series, making the transition period very short, it is certain that Jokic will not play 48 minutes in each game. The Heat and Nuggets also have a bright spot on the issue of substitute centers, and the Nuggets have become accustomed to not having to substitute centers. The Heat's forward line is average in thickness, which is why Love needs to be online, which can at least guarantee the few minutes after Reba comes off the court. If there are no problems with the substitute center, you can bet on the status of Lowry, Dun Luo and others, and combine the team defense to target the Nuggets bench space to establish an advantage during this period. If Hiero can return early and is in good condition, the Heat will have one more player in their rotation, and his ball-holding characteristics will be very useful for the Nuggets. If the above conditions are met, the Heat are by no means helpless. In fact, for neutral fans, who wins and who loses is not that important. The important thing is that we will enjoy a finals that is fun no matter what. Thinking of the waiting and growth that Jokic and the Nuggets have experienced in the past few years, you will hope that they will reach the top, and thinking of the Heat's tenacious will to not be afraid of strong opponents along the way, you will hope that they will stay in the dark. Obviously, in the hearts of people who really love basketball, they are already winners. They won the process and should not be defined by the results. I will hope that there will be two different AB plots in parallel worlds, so that both sides can win the rewards they deserve in the most glorious way. This cannot be achieved, and even if it could be achieved, oneself, who must be in one of the A/B worlds, would not know the situation on the other side. It doesn't matter, whichever side wins, it will carry an inspirational legend worth remembering. At the end of the season, they were both No. 1 on the list.

4.91E+15,N37jyAPiQ,7287900937,lower case liren sd,"When it comes to the finals again, I will write down two sentences about watching the game. Generally speaking, compared with ten or twenty years ago, there are several important changes in the NBA today: there are more 3-pointers (the proportion of shots has increased from about 20% to about 20%). to a historical peak of nearly 40%), the court space is large, the pick-and-roll is used a lot, there are many transition attacks (one of the reasons is that the 3-point rebound bounces far), the game is fast-paced (the average number of paces per game has exceeded 100), and the offensive efficiency is high ( 110+, historical peak). This trend originated from the magic ball (small ball) in the 10s and the changes in the rules to encourage offense. I won’t go into details. I want to say a few results: In terms of the appearance of the game, the run range was large, and three 3-pointers were scored in a row. Close to the past, scoring 5 rounds in a row has increased the chance of winning. In recent years, the proportion of games with a score difference of 20+ is close to 30%. The second is team tactics. Due to the changes in space and pick-and-roll, individual defense is not the main thing. Defensive defense switching, delay block, rotation, supplementary position, contraction, assist defense, flanking attack, etc. determine the defensive efficiency. Simply put, it relies more on the ""system"" , the offense is actually the same, you can take advantage of the pick-and-roll, score 3 points after breaking through or covering the movement, cover the semi-vacation after handoff at the top of the arc, stand in the bottom corner during fast break, and misplace small to hit big. Becoming the main tactic, these changes will bring about the third point: the technical requirements for players have changed. Traditional one-on-one skills such as standing as human shields, hard cuts inside, maneuvering in small spaces, holding the ball and pulling up mid-range shots, etc. (at least in the regular season) have been reduced. On the contrary, fast movement, especially lateral movement, grabbing rebounds and pushing transitions, transferring the ball in large spaces, fixing the spot and even holding the ball for 3 points, facing the ball when facing a double attack, having a body shape that can cope with mismatches, and optimizing shot selection include Certain foul-making skills, etc., are becoming more and more important, and the corresponding stadium culture will also change. Therefore, just like the abundance of swingmen at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the stars of this era are organizational forwards, and their three major statistics tend to rise with the tide. However, the shortcomings of one-on-one skills may also be magnified in the playoffs, and due to the 3-pointer With the efficiency bonus, role players, especially shooters with size, can often perform as well as stars in a single game. It has been common in the recent Eastern Conference and Western Conference finals. The playoffs are a round-based system. Analysis based on data, matchups and tactics is on the one hand, and on the other hand, it is the grasp of on-the-spot momentum. In many cases, everything goes smoothly and mistakes are made. Under the same confrontation scale, here If they don’t score in two or three rounds, or if they don’t get a foul, they immediately push for a conversion and a 5-7 point gap appears. Why is Jokic so good? Technically, his comprehensiveness, mismatch advantage, vision, etc. There has been a lot of discussion, but the additional point is his on-the-spot adaptability, such as returning an answerflop after being fouled, and stealing a 3-pointer when the game is blocked. This kind of thing seems to be a piece of cake for him, a stalemate under high pressure, Victory or defeat is often reversed by details like this. Both the Nuggets and Heat have performed like this this year. It will be interesting to watch who can grasp the momentum better.",,,,,0,0,1,5/31/23 12:10,Weibo web version,,,

4.91E+15,N5XWkg94T,5549561499,Tutu Basketball Park,"Let me write down what I didn’t finish yesterday. Considering that the Mavericks are very interested in Dun Bao, my idea is to use Ayton to trade with the Mavericks. The Suns take Powell's 10 million contract, and then take Bertans for two years, 17 million this year and 16 million next year, plus a big McGee for 5.7 million and 6 million in two years. After saying all the above, you must feel that you are at a loss, but don’t worry. My thought is that the Suns could ask for their rookie Josh Green and this year's No. 10 pick. Among them, Josh Green is a rookie with immediate combat ability and potential. He can not only help the Suns compete for the championship but also be trained for the future. As for the No. 10 pick, my idea is to trade down for two first-round picks. One of them will select a player they like in the first round this year (I heard the Suns have a target), which can be used as a rookie bonus in the next 2-3 years; the other first round will be placed in the future and can be postponed as needed, or through trade. Postponed later. The Powell mentioned above only has 1,000,000 in the last year, which is easy to deal with; the slightly more difficult thing is Bertans's 1,600,000, but if it cannot be traded, considering that the Suns are short of shooters, it is not impossible to use it; and can Big McGee be one? A fake starting center is also something that can be considered... Of course, if the Suns renew Randall's contract, Randall will definitely be the starting five, so McGee will be enough to replace the inside.

The Heat made 17 of 35 three-pointers, with a shooting percentage of 48.6%. They used their best three-pointers to ""punish"" the Nuggets, which also added more suspense to the finals. After the two sides return to the same starting line, the finals will move to Miami's home court, and the Nuggets will become the ""problem-solving"" side. Do we want to limit the performance of the Heat's outside shooters more? How to strengthen the connection between Jokic and his teammates?

Today, Nuggets forward Michael Porter was interviewed by reporters. Talking about areas where he can improve, Porter said: ""Personally, I feel that the intensity and energy of the game are not as high as they need to be, and the same is true for the entire team. We can discuss the mistakes we made on the defensive end, but The important thing is intensity. We have some issues that need to be addressed. They are a very good team. Some of their tactics are difficult to defend. So, our communication has to be in place, but really, I think communication is the most important thing, Because that kind of lax defense makes it look like we're not playing hard because they get open looks. We need to focus on what we have to do."" Porter also said: ""We know that in the second game of the series, we let an opportunity Slip away... We're playing a really good team, gotta give them credit."" ""We've got to get after their shooters. They got too many open looks the first two games."" ""They had some tough spots. Defensive tactics, there are some very unique tactics that may only be played by them. They have many shooters who will set screens and then go directly outside, trying to confuse your defensive tactics, whether you switch defenses or not. So, I think this It's the most important thing. That's why I emphasize communication, because they want us to be enlightened on the defensive end and we have to focus on the game plan."" ""Our communication may be better and we should pay more attention to their tactics, but They're also taking advantage of our defensive play, they hear what we're saying to each other, and they do the opposite. If we say 'switch,' they just go outside and shoot a 3. If we don't say 'switch,' they really do. to set screens. So they took advantage of our game plan very well."" Talking about the Heat using smaller players to defend themselves, Porter said: ""Yes, I think part of making sacrifices for the team is that sometimes some of us feel I can hit mismatches, but that's not how the offense is played at that time. Sometimes you can try to hit mismatches in transition. Obviously if Gabe Vincent is guarding me, then I think I can get the ball and score. But that's not how this team plays offensively, that's not how we've played all season. So, if that means even if I'm mismatched, I'm going to open the floor, and that's what I'm going to do.""",,,,,0,0,0,6/7/23 13:37,NBA Super Talk,['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006TVSORly1heplnqcqc9j30h00bct9q.jpg'],,

4.91E+15,N3UjW1WDW,2552706722,My name is Li Yongqin,"@heatTalk@Jimmy Butler Information The Heat returned to normalcy in the NBA Finals. They won an away game and regained the home court advantage. There are several scary things that I have to mention: 1. Nuggets fans collectively lost their voices. In the last game, people who shouted, ""The Nuggets are definitely 4-0"", ""The Nuggets are crushing them, the Heat have no chance"", ""The Nuggets played like a training game, they didn't even break a sweat during the appointment with the teacher"", were driven crazy. Slap in the face. Where to put this face? Where did all these Nuggets fans suddenly come from? I seriously suspect that the Lakers fans were demolished and supported the Nuggets after their heads were shaved. Only when the Nuggets shave their heads again and become the Eastern Conference champions can they have any reason to comfort themselves or continue to praise the Lakers. 2. The Nuggets team’s scoring advantage is no longer there. Today, Jokic played at a high level. This is indeed a crushing strength and stands out from the crowd. However, the Heat's tentative strategic goal in the last game has been achieved, which is to rather score points for Jokic than to send him wonderful passes, blocking the connection between him and his teammates, making teamwork no longer smooth, and indirectly suppressing others. scoring ability. It's clear that today's tactics worked. 3. The Heat's shooters are back. In the G1 battle, only Vincent among the Heat's shooters was normal, Strus and Martin performed abnormally, and the other Strus missed three-pointers in many open situations, which was a fatal factor in the loss. No matter whether the opponent's offense can be defended or not, the first thing to solve is the stable output of the team. It can be seen from the statistics of the game that the Heat's inside scoring and rebounds are about the same as the Nuggets. The gap is not as big as many people said. Even the Nuggets' defensive level is average, and to a large extent, the ""plateau"" is helping the defense. The Heat have many The ball was played in an open position, and the number of two-point and three-point shots was one more than that of the Nuggets. This shows that there are still more scoring opportunities, but they just did not seize the opportunity. Data is the best evidence, and data speaks for itself. 4. The psychological quality of the Heat players has once again been raised to another level. From the Black Eight icon to the present, the Heat have been behind by double digits many times and have calmly caught up with the score. The players' psychological quality and ability to withstand pressure are truly terrifying to the extreme. Today, they were caught up when they took the lead at the beginning, and then opened up a double-digit gap. In the last quarter, they overtook and confirmed their advantage. Although they suffered a counterattack at home later, it was not that they made any mistakes in the last few minutes. The twists and turns of the situation make this group of guys who have experienced miracles even more confident that they can get to the end! The Heat are back at home, their self-confidence is back, the support and cheers of the home fans are back, and more importantly, the familiar environment is back. On the contrary, can the Nuggets' chatting and laughing attitude continue? How to deal with adversity after one ebb and flow?

4.91E+15,N31l8ix2h,7555189816,"Haha, laugh, brother","Only top-level professionals are likely to earn more than the average amount of money. ——Haha, Xiaoxiao, average players are mediocre. Ordinary people are considered mediocre workers. Ordinary middle class people are weak. I saw a video: Thompson was in a shooting competition in complete darkness. He scored 7 or 8 goals. I can’t remember. In short, the shooting rate was very high. In the same environment, under the same conditions, Durant seems to have 7 to 8. The purpose of the competition is very simple, just to see the shooting performance of the NBA's top shooters under extreme conditions and see who is better. It’s just that there’s only video of Thompson and Durant. Many things seem simple, but in fact, they are extremely difficult to do. Everyone who plays basketball knows that playing the whole court and most of the court require completely different levels of physical strength, technical and tactical skills, and basic personal skills. Run back and forth a few times throughout the field, and if there is a confrontation, you can basically leave. Walk over, walk over, occasionally pass the ball, and look defensively. Not to mention shooting, he can attack immediately and defend like a god on the field. Things are afraid of comparison. Ordinary people shoot 3-pointers during the day. You can really see that they can't make a few. If you make one out of 10, it's very impressive. But the level is still too far apart. The world's top players, in complete darkness, completely based on the muscle memory and ball feel of daily training, just shot 7 out of 10, which scared ordinary people to death. This is the real gap between ordinary people and professional players. Think about it, there is also a huge difference in the professional level between ordinary people and professionals when it comes to career and money-making skills. There is no need to question this. If you look at the reviews among peers and look at the financial performance, you will know that the gap in level is so huge that it basically makes ordinary people despair. Having said that, how can abilities grow vertically? Look at Butler, look at Curry, he has been training his basic skills for ten years, and he has been training professionally for ten years. As long as you are brave, as long as you are patient, patient, patient, and hardworking, time will become your friend and your guide. Therefore, quantity is the key, the amount of training is the key, and the workload is the key. Only quantitative changes can lead to qualitative changes, and continuous qualitative changes can evolve the professional level to the top level in the industry.

Brown had already shown his original shape in the second half of the season. Pope could only invest in large spaces with extremely low output. position, the well-known Nuggets bench is just a plus-minus for Jokic. Needless to say, the Bucks and Celtics in the East, just think about the West, Jokic’s nemesis Curry, Morant, and even Westbrook. I am really worried that these people will beat Jokic to pieces in the first round. Edwards' outburst only heightened fears of this. However, along the way, Jokic's enemies were eliminated first, but they played steadily and made almost no mistakes. Jokic was still as steady as a mountain. The shooters made most of the open three-pointers. Murray also proved that the park Not a flash in the pan.

4.91E+15,N2RY7qGJL,6110269359,Taiwu car god,"Most of what Bucks reporter Eric Nelm writes is indifferent, but you can still read it. I feel like some more intense points of view are needed, this stuff is so bland. Personally, I think it’s okay to choose a teaching assistant. But the main test for the Bucks coach is the playoffs. ""What does Adrian Griffin need to do to get the Bucks back on championship track?"" 》The Milwaukee Bucks have decided on their next head coach. According to league sources, the Bucks will hire Toronto Raptors assistant coach Adrian Griffin as the team's 17th head coach. After a three-week process in which general manager Jon Horst considered more than a dozen candidates, the Bucks decided Griffin was the right coach to lead them to success, and the goals were clear in that regard. ""We're going to come back next year and try to get better, try to develop good habits and try to play better,"" Bucks superstar forward Giannis Antetokounmpo said after the Bucks' upset first-round loss No. 8 seed Miami said afterward. heat. ""Not playing bad basketball for 10 days in a row. And, hopefully, we can win a championship."" Trying to win a championship in your first season as the head coach of a team is a difficult task for anyone, but this That's exactly what Griffin will be doing with the Bucks next season. It's a fair goal considering the team's recent success and the talent on the roster. The Milwaukee Bucks championship changed expectations. The next head coach needs to meet them For Griffin, everything about this journey, and the team's path forward, starts with Antetokounmpo. When Mike Budenholzer took over as head coach five years ago, Giannis Antetokounmpo's potential seemed endless, but the Bucks' Greek forward had never been named to an All-Pro team. Five years later, Antetokounmpo clearly realizes much of his potential. Antetokounmpo has been a unanimous vote to the All-NBA First Team in each of the past five seasons. He earned four more All-Defensive team nominations and won the 2020 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He is a two-time NBA MVP, NBA Finals MVP and NBA champion. But as Antetokounmpo is quick to remind people, he can always get better. Griffin's first priority moving forward will be helping Antetokounmpo become a better player. As reported in The Athletic on Saturday, Antetokounmpo is backing Griffin for the position, and that support should help as Griffin and Antetokounmpo work together to help the Bucks chase the franchise's third NBA title. champion. But as he enters his 11th NBA season in 2023, finding new ways to help Antetokounmpo get better won't be easy. As Antetokounmpo enters his sixth NBA season at 24 years old, Budenholzer's path forward is easier and cleaner. Five years later, Antetokounmpo has become the most dominant force in the NBA. Antetokounmpo is no longer looking to go from good to great; Griffin is tasked with helping one of the league's best players go from great to greater. How will the Milwaukee Bucks search for a coach? Previous searches may provide clues Rather than have a chance to revolutionize an offense like Budenholzer's, which desperately needs more three-pointers and better spacing, Griffin needs to find a way to build a modern offense. , using Antetokounmpo’s dominance at the rim and ball-handling ability with his hands to create something similar after Budenholzer. Griffin is tasked with setting up the offense in his own vision, accomplishing many of the same things while also creating easier scoring opportunities for Antetokounmpo, so the Bucks' 7-footer doesn't always have to go around Defenders need to get to the rim. That doesn't just fall on Griffin. Antetokounmpo needs to be an important part of this process. Together, they need to figure out what Antetokounmpo needs to do to continue to develop offensively, as Antetokounmpo's shooting numbers stalled last season for the first time under Budenholzer. Antetokounmpo's accuracy as a shooter hasn't increased in a perfectly linear fashion under Budenholzer, but the general trend line over their first four seasons seems to indicate the player is becoming more comfortable in the coach's offensive system. The eye test looks to match up, too, with Antetokounmpo seemingly becoming more comfortable finishing his shots — jump hooks, floaters, baseline spins, mid-range jumpers — that don’t require him to bully defenders all the time before. Basket last season. But then, as his usage rate reached a career high, those numbers regressed back to what they were in his first season under Budenholzer. Things won't be that easy for Antetokounmpo, much like what happened to Budenholzer in the playoffs. Over the past five seasons, the Bucks' half-court offense has often struggled to produce when it matters most in the playoffs. For example, after the Bucks led 101-89 with 6:01 left in the fourth quarter of Game 4, the Bucks failed to create and complete a beautiful offense on the offensive end. The Heat were scoreless and went on a 13-0 run. Two days later, in the Bucks' Game 5 loss to the Heat, the Bucks scored 102 points entering the fourth quarter; after 12 minutes, they had only scored 16 points, with the Heat leading the fourth quarter 32-16. quarter entered overtime, knocking the Bucks out of the playoffs. Those moments in the playoffs are the most difficult to run an offense, but Griffin and the coaching staff he ultimately assembled needed to make it easier for Antetokounmpo and his teammates. Because Griffin was a first-time head coach, there was no previous game tape to study for cues he might try to implement. It's possible he'll try to fit in some of what the Raptors have done over the past five seasons, but the Raptors' half-court offense hasn't been particularly strong over the past three seasons, so that might not even be a good idea. Whatever Griffin is paired with will be his first try in an NBA offense. While Griffin will certainly need to create an offensive environment where Antetokounmpo can not only continue to thrive, but also improve moving forward, that's not his only job. The Bucks have also been an elite defensive team over the past five seasons under Budenholzer, with three All-Defensive teams in Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday and Brook Lopez. honor. Throughout his nine-year NBA career, Griffin was a tenacious defensive wing. For eight of his first 10 years as an assistant, Griffin was part of defensive-minded coaching staffs such as Scott Skiles and Tom Thibodeau. . For the past five seasons, Griffin has been a member of Nick Nurse's staff, and the Raptors' defense has been one of the NBA's most aggressive, pressure-based defenses focused on forcing turnovers, in large part. goes against Budenholzer's defensive game plan of trying to contain offensive players into designated areas away from the basket while avoiding fouling at all costs. Look at how both teams defended Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell in the pick-and-roll last season. During the Bucks' game against the Cavaliers in November, Bucks guard George Hill fought over a screen to prevent Mitchell from attempting a three-pointer and push him toward the mid-range. Lopez was in deep drop coverage, waited for Mitchell at his left elbow, then started shooting as Mitchell attacked, culminating in Mitchell hitting a pull-up jumper with Hill defending from behind. Now, look at what the Raptors did last season. Just like Hill, Fred VanVleet came over the screen to chase Mitchell from behind. But instead of waiting in a deep drop screen like Lopez did, OG Nunoby caught Mitchell at screen level and immediately began to pressure the ballhandler, ultimately leading to a steal as VanVleet chased down the play. Now, the Bucks and Raptors have very different rosters. The Raptors have been without a center for most of the past two seasons, so it's easier for them to set up a trap, switch, blitz and pressure defense than the Bucks, who have a larger and older group. . But these are decisions Griffin will have to make as he develops a vision for the team, and he'll need to make them with Horst. At the beginning of the interview process, Horst again spoke about how important it is to him to have a strong partnership with the Bucks head coach for the past five years. With the Bucks making some big decisions this offseason, work begins immediately on building a connection between Griffin and Horst. It's unclear if Lopez and Khris Middleton will return next season, but if Horst retains much of the Bucks' roster from last season, Griffin will need to figure out how to develop a roster that can help the Bucks Project In his first season as an NBA head coach, he maintained an elite team on both ends of the floor and had success in the playoffs. Who will the Bucks target in their search for a head coach? 'Everything should be on the table' The task will be difficult for Griffin, but by no means impossible. Since the ABA-NBA merger in 1976, five rookie head coaches — Paul Westhead, Pat Riley, Steve Kerr, Tyronn Lue and Nurse — have won the NBA title. championship, with the last three winning it all in the last nine seasons. Rookie head coaches Darvin Ham and Joe Mazzulla have led their respective teams - the Lakers and Celtics - to the conference finals this season, and former Celtics head coach Ime Udoka led Boston to last season's NBA Finals. finals. The Bucks have a real chance to follow in those teams' footsteps and find success in Griffin's first season. Over the past five seasons, no team has won more regular-season games than the Bucks. They won the franchise's second NBA championship in 2021. They have one of the best players in the world in his prime, but they have fallen short of expectations the past two seasons. With Middleton injured in 2021 and Antetokounmpo injured in 2022, they may have valid reasons for being eliminated early in the playoffs, but this does not change the fact that what happened is that the Bucks did not live up to expectations in the playoffs. Four of their past five seasons. The Eastern Conference will still have good teams next season, but when the regular season ends in four and a half months, the Bucks should once again be the favorite to represent the East in the 2024 NBA Finals. No one knows what Griffin will do as a first-time head coach. His offensive and defensive schemes will be a mystery until the Bucks first step on the court next fall, but that doesn't mean expectations will be any different. With Antetokounmpo leading a talented team, the Bucks' championship window remains open, and Griffin in his first season needs to figure out how to make sure the Bucks take advantage of it.",,,,,0,7,29,5/29/23 21:05,Weibo web version,,,

(They probably have Poole on their minds!) With Golden State becoming synonymous with the three-point era, Sasser, one of the truly great shooters in the 2023 NBA Draft, should get plenty of attention from this prestigious organization. . Especially in the 2023 NBA Warriors playoffs, only two rotation players shot more than 35% (Klay and Curry!) The media believes that his shooting! Will provide outside help to the Warriors! Because Warriors head coach Steve Kerr often struggles to develop young players or trust them, it puts Sasser's potential impact in Golden State into question.

4.91E+15,N55NShgPe,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"Denver Nuggets, 47-year team history, first NBA championship in 2023. Nikola Jokic, the undisputed Finals MVP. The Miami Heat acted as a perfect loser: losing the game 1-4, in Game 5, they suddenly created the atmosphere of Game 7 and fought until the last moment of the game. The Heat didn't surrender, didn't give the Nuggets garbage time, and didn't let Denver celebrate early. The Denver Nuggets won the championship only after they defeated the Heat. The real deal. The game started like a typical desperate struggle: the Heat forced the Nuggets to make 4 turnovers in the first 2 minutes, cut passing lanes, counterattacked dunks, and Strus made a 5-0 buzzer beater. ——In Game 5 of 2014, the Heat started in the same way and stunned the Spurs. But then Heat missed 10 shots and the Nuggets found their rhythm: Heat locked the three-point line? Then KCP breaks through the three-point line and makes a mid-range shot; Gordon takes the mismatch alone; Porter cuts inside; on the defensive end, Gordon, KCP and Murray take turns facing Jimmy. The Nuggets reached 12-5 in one breath and stopped the heat. However, Reno called it a day. It was 37-year-old Kyle Lowry who saved the game. In the last game, he had used chasing three-pointers and cunning dives to lead the wave in the second quarter, and it was the same today: the Heat switched defenses, and Lowry went to carry Jokic; he speeded up and led the Heat team to attack. Basket: Found Martin to attack the basket, quickly passed Struss for a counterattack and dunk, assisted Adebayor in the mid-range shot to make it 16-18, blocked Braun and started a counterattack: Jokic fouled for the second time. As soon as Jokic came off the court, Lowry immediately directed the team to look for Adebayor: he beat Jeff Green twice 2+1, and the Heat instantly took the lead. What Adebayo and Lowry mean: Want a championship? Fight over our heads! ! The game that followed was extremely weird: Because of the fouls between Gordon and Jokic, the Nuggets even blocked Jordan, ""Griffin! Paul! I'm in the finals too! - I even blocked Vincent!"" Porter finally showed his value: he still couldn't score a three-pointer, but he added offensive rebounds and cut inside. He scored 7 points and 6 rebounds in the first quarter. When Jokic went down, he blocked Adeba. about. In the second quarter of the last game, it was Gordon vs. Lowry. Today, Gordon committed three fouls at the beginning of the second quarter: Jokic personally faced Lowry. When the Heat once led by double digits, Jokic faced Lowry's attempt to commit a foul and still made a shot. He then assisted KCP to rush into the corner. Coupled with Bruce's counterattack, the Nuggets caught up to 4 points in one breath; Lowry immediately responded with a three-pointer and a floater, suppressing the Nuggets. How persistent is Lori? After a fake move and being kicked down by Bruce, Lowry, a 37-year-old man, stood up and his first reaction was to emphasize to the referee: I have a shooting action! Give me three free throws! The game was so difficult, but the Nuggets slowly caught up in the third quarter: neither side put a three-point line, so they could only watch the breakthrough; Porter's breakthrough throw, Murray's breakthrough rebound, and Gordon cutting inside to the basket. , Jokic's consecutive singles: the Nuggets caught up to 60 draws. After getting hot again, the Nuggets relied on defensive counterattacks to chase points. Porter hit a three-pointer that had been dormant for the whole series, 69 to 66: At that moment, it should be the Nuggets' rhythm. However, Lowry still refused to admit defeat and made another three-pointer to drag the game into the fourth quarter 70-71. The two heroes of this period of the Nuggets: - When Jokic came on the court, Adebayor's offense was more or less extinguished. Jokic's quick hands and presence under the basket made Heat's breakthrough ineffective. ——Gordon is extremely smart: every time he and Jimmy hit the target without the ball, the first thing he did was show his hand to the referee: I didn’t take advantage of his emergency stop fake move! No foul! Don't let him take free throws! In the fourth quarter, the Nuggets had a smooth start: Jokic faced Zeller's shot 72 to 71. The Nuggets used an unprecedented full defense switch. Jokic even rushed to the three-point line to expand the defense. The Heat were at a loss for a moment; then the Nuggets team moved the ball, Murray made a three-pointer: 75 to 71, and the Heat immediately paused. 5-0 within one minute was not a big climax, but Coach Spoelstra understood: if we don’t clean up the situation at this time, the game will be over. ——In other words, Murray is a little talkative, and he will keep saying hello to his teammates, and he will have some fun by himself. On the sidelines, the veteran Jordan keeps cheering Murray: win the game! You will enter history! ! What followed was a brutal duel: Game 5 had the atmosphere of Game 7. Martin made a Kobe-style reverse layup to catch up to 73-75. Gordon stole Jimmy's counterattack and Jokic made a strong shot from inside. Lowry still refused to give up and hit a three-pointer from the left corner, forcing Jokic to finally Sombor used his signature swing shot: 79 to 76. ——As an aside, Jokic’s right-footed takeoff golden rooster was practiced when his left foot was injured in 2017. “I wanted to use my right foot to exert force to avoid injury to my left foot,” and it turned out to be his signature style. What a wonderful fate. ——Injuries delayed Murray for a year and a half, Porter for a year, and the Nuggets for two seasons, but they also gave Jokic a trick. Jokic went straight to the basket, Braun got a free throw and missed both; Murray made his sixth mistake; Strus interfered with Braun's fast break layup - the hidden protagonist of this section is the data Jokic's defensive effect cannot be shown: He was in the penalty area and blocked all the Heat's layups. Finally, Gordon blocked Lowry head-on, and Murray, gasping for breath, hit a mid-range shot: 81 to 76, and the Nuggets once again stopped the heat. Lowry's frontcourt foul hindered the Nuggets' counterattack, allowing the Heat time to set up a zone defense, but Jokic rode a horse and shot 83 to 76, breaking the zone defense again. At this point, Adebayor in the first quarter and Lowry in the second and third quarters have all worked hard. Who else is Miami Fever? Jimmy Butler seemed to suddenly remember: The time has come. Jimmy, who had previously made 2 of 13 shots, first hit a three-pointer from the corner; KCP took advantage of the hot three-and-two for an open three-pointer; Jimmy immediately hit another three-pointer, and then got a three-point foul: Coach Malone's challenge failed, Jimmy He made three free throws and scored 9 points in a row; he hit KCP on the back again and scored 11 points in a row: the Heat went ahead 87 to 86. Jokic took Martin alone to take the lead, and then Lowry made a last-ditch effort: hitting the offensive rebound, allowing Jimmy to break through and get a free throw, and the Heat regained the lead. This is the last minute. The aces are all out of ammunition and food, and it's up to everyone else. ——Jimmy played against Murray, broke through, faced Jokic, stopped, passed the ball, made a mistake, and was picked off by KCP. The game actually ends here. After Bruce Brown made a free throw, the championship was settled. That's it: a hot opening blitz that resulted in a series of turnovers, but the Nuggets survived. Lowry brought speed, Adebayor dominated the first quarter, and the Nuggets survived. Lowry's enchanting performance in the second quarter helped the Nuggets survive. The lead came back late in the third quarter, but Lowry refused to admit defeat. At the end of the fourth quarter, Jimmy Butler flashed out of thin air and scored 13 points in a row. The Nuggets were about to reverse the game - the Nuggets won with Bruce Brown's rebound and KCP's steal. The Nuggets passed the test of the Heat, refined their skills and won the championship. After the game, Murray immediately bent over and covered his eyes, crying uncontrollably. You can imagine his mood: three years ago, the Nuggets reached the Western Conference Finals, Murray became famous in one game, and then he was injured and rested for a year and a half. Three years later, the Nuggets' Barton, Harris, Grant, Millsap, Morris, Craig, and Plumlee were all gone. Only Jokic and Porter are still there. The vicissitudes of life have come a long way, and today, we have the championship. ——And Murray is actually only 26 years old; Porter is not yet 25 years old. After two seasons delayed by injuries, they finally got everything. Also included: Gordon, who has played in only five playoff games with the Orlando Magic for six and a half years, is the No. 1 defense on the championship team against LeBron, Jimmy, Durant and Booker this season. People. Bruce Brown, the 42nd pick in the draft, followed his big brother KCP of the Detroit Pistons and became a guard for the championship team. After Jeff Green moved to eleven teams, he finally won the championship before his old buddies Harden and Westbrook. Jordan won the championship before Paul and Griffin. How amazing. 2023 Finals MVP Nikola Jokic. This season's playoffs total points are 600, ranking first in the league; total rebounds are 269, ranking first in the league; total assists are 190, ranking first in the league. The first player in history to rank first in all three playoff games. The Finals was the series in which he averaged the fewest assists per game in the playoffs this season - 7.2 assists per game - and Coach Spoelstra meant: Don't let him organize the offense. So Jokic easily averaged 31 points per game. In today's strangling game, he scored 28 points on 16 shots. A well-deserved Finals MVP. In the 2003 NBA draft, LeBron became the No. 1 pick, Milicic was the No. 2 pick, and Melo was the No. 3 overall pick. Milicic promoted Nemanja Jokic, his good friend in Serbia, and gave him the opportunity to play at UDM at the University of Detroit. Nemanja did not play in the NBA, but he hung out with Milicic and later called himself , ""This is how I saw the life of NBA players."" Nemanja later returned to his hometown of Sombor, Serbia, and told his fat brother Nikola Jokic, who drank a gallon of Coke a day and liked basketball, horse racing, water polo, and football, that he should focus on basketball, "" You should work hard to play in the NBA in the future!"" Jokic was selected with the 41st pick in 2014 and started playing in the NBA in 2015. In 2019, Nuggets assistant coach Eichenberg advised Jokic, ""You can aim for MVP."" He lost 10 pounds, ""I feel good."" He lost 20 pounds, ""Can I dunk?"" He lost 30 pounds, ""I can accelerate!"" We all know what happened after that. Twenty years after Milicic was selected as the second overall pick in 2003, Nikola Jokic, the younger brother of his good friend Nemanja Jokic, wore the No. 15 Nuggets jersey worn by Melo, the third overall pick in 2003. On the day Melo retired, he eliminated the 2003 No. 1 pick LeBron and entered the Nuggets' first Finals. Today we won the first championship in Nuggets history. In October 2016, before Jokic started his second year, I wrote a pre-season article about the Nuggets: ""Denver Nuggets, very suitable for pure basketball fans."" Because the Nuggets at that time: a large number of double inside corner positions to support; telescopic offense; positioning screens; double wing cuts. Instead of rushing to shoot three-pointers (except for Gallinari), everyone passed the ball, passed the ball, blocked and cut, moved the ball, and cut inside to make free throws. And: There were a few days last season when I was discussing Jokic privately with a few friends. The promotional words everyone used were: ""Sabonis! Sabonis!!"" Nikola Jokic: As long as he doesn't get injured , he will enter the best team of the year in the 2020 and 2024 Men's Basketball World Championships... The premise is that their country will not produce any new talents. He is omnipotent, truly omnipotent. He can shoot three-pointers. He has the stocky stature of a big white tower in Europe. In his rookie season, he sent out 189 assists, 79 steals and 50 blocks in 1,733 minutes - more steals than blocks. His passing is not accurate, but he has Sabonis's unbridled sense of sway. Once he stands at the waist, his pass will go to an unknown place in the next second. We rarely talk about vision when discussing the Giants, but he deserves it. The difference between him and the entire league is that he has no shortcomings: range, touch, movement, and IQ. And, because of his passing vision, he's a giant who can play pivot. Therefore, it is extremely gratifying to see Jokic playing like this today. And, the trend of the times. Everyone is still used to talking about the small ball era, but the fact is: the top insiders of three of the past four championships are: Nong Mei, Giannis, and Jokic. The past five regular season MVPs: two for Giannis, two for Jokic, and one for Embiid. In the past three years, the top two MVPs in the regular season have been Embiid and Jokic; in the past two years, the top three MVPs have been Embiid, Jokic and Giannis. The Warriors won the championship in 2022 and Curry's Finals MVP is now more like Curry's personal bravery; the fact is that since 2020, if you don't count Curry's magic in 2022, it is really an era dominated by the top giants. After all, after the space age and the three-pointer grouping, the ones who benefited the most were the centers: the four major centers from 1993-95 were also the beginning of the three-pointer trend. Of course, the styles are different. This era is conducive to passing masters due to the vast space and the excellent shooter threat. Coach Malone said he regarded Jokic as Duncan. Popovich said Jokic is Bird again. In terms of technical positioning, Jokic is a center-sized Bird, or a more versatile offensive Sabonis; and Malone's so-called ""treating him as Duncan"" is a matter of team culture. The reason why Bird and Magic were successful with the Celtics and Lakers was because when the team leaders took the lead and were selfless, the entire team would start passing the ball. The Nuggets are second in assists during the regular season this season, second only to the defending champion Warriors, who are well-versed in passing and cutting routines. After the first game of the Finals, Porter said, ""We are selfless and we want everyone to succeed. This is the culture of our team."" Gordon said, ""Every time I see Gordon is open, every time I pass the ball Give it to him, no matter what happens. Because passing to the open space is the right choice."" Porter's summary is, ""We all try to play like this."" So who takes the lead in this play? ""Nikola is the beginning of it all."" The tenacious, selfless and tough team is rooted in a man who can obviously produce all kinds of historical data, but is willing to dress up the whole team. This is how the team culture is established. Duncan is to the Spurs, Curry is to the Warriors, and Nash is to the Suns. I wrote a paragraph at the beginning of the year, looking at Jokic from Gordon's perspective: Imagine you are a dunk genius, but your seven-year NBA career has not been successful; when you are on a team, the two-time MVP feeds you the best basket cake in the NBA every day. Let you dunk at will; on the night when he scored 41 points, 15 rebounds and 15 assists, he told the media that you were the soul of the team. What will you do at this time? Therefore, Gordon flies into the sky and escapes from the ground in every game, exerting his strength on both offense and defense. He can ""do everything on the court"" and really shows his strength. He just has to fight to the death to repay his confidant. Determining whether a person is a good teammate is actually that simple: it is clear at a glance whether his teammates are willing to fight for him. ——That’s what it means. This season, two-time regular season MVP Jokic, the second team of the year, won the championship. Last season, Curry, the two-time regular season MVP and the second team of the year, won the championship. The year before last, Giannis, the two-time regular season MVP, lost the regular season MVP and won the championship. In April 2017, Curry, the two-time regular season MVP, said that he had long given up on trying to hit the 73-win record, that it was ""not worth it"" to not think about the MVP, and that he just wanted to stay until the playoffs: So that year , won the championship. In the 2019 Western Conference semifinals, the Nuggets played seven games with the Trail Blazers. Jokic averaged 27+14+8 per game, but he ran out of energy at the end of the seventh game and scored 29 points, 13 rebounds and 2 assists on 11-of-26 shooting. After the game, he went to the locker room to apologize to the coach, saying that he would not let the team down in the future; the entire Nuggets team was stunned: ""Nikola, do you know? Without you, we wouldn't be able to survive the third round. Seven games!"" Jokic doesn't use rhetoric, but he keeps the team in his heart. Jokic played less than 50 minutes in the last seven regular season games this season and scored 20 points. He won't strive for the historic three consecutive regular season MVP awards. MVP is gone. The year is gone for a while. He just wants to win. So this season's playoffs, first in points, first in rebounds, first in assists. Ten triple-doubles. 30+20+10 in two games, 30+17+17 in one game, and 53 points and 10 assists in one game. Won the championship. He built the culture of the team. He led the team through the low period of injury and displacement. He gave something up, had a historic playoff run and Finals, proved he was the best player on the planet at this moment, and won a championship. So, finally, of course, it’s time to end the 2022-23 season with these words: “When someone has won two MVPs and still accomplished nothing, why should I feel pressure?” ——2022-23 Regular Season MVP, Joe Embiid. #NBAfinals##Nuggets vs. Heat##Jokicfmvp#",,,,"NBA finals, Nuggets vs Heat, Jokic fmvp",251,202,1835,6/13/23 11:59,Weibo web version,['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hewgilytbuj30yd0i24gh.jpg'],,

However, some technical means rely too much on three-point ax for a single breakthrough. He always jumps in to stop the ball. He will cause a foul when he sways, and he will turn around if he doesn't stagger. Take a jump shot and pass it to the ambushing shooter at the three-point line if there is no space. It has been difficult to play since Kaizi saw it in the fourth game. The Nuggets feel as if they have studied it in advance and have not taken advantage of this trick from the beginning.

After choosing to split the ball, the Heat's three-point shooter was also surrounded and had no room to shoot, so he looked for other shooting opportunities. On the last ball, Butler broke through and passed the ball directly to the opponent, which was the epitome of this game. To put it bluntly, the Heat just don't have the ability to attack hard, and they don't have the ability to solve the problem. They just don't have enough talent.

Is it more acceptable to have Jokic pass a few balls to drive away outside shooters or to have Jokic post up a few times? I don't think this should even be an issue, the difference in production development is there. When you flank someone, you may prevent him from passing the ball, you may cause him to make a mistake or make up for it through rotation, but when facing a teacher, these possibilities are minimized. The Timberwolves, Suns and Lakers all have theoretically better one-on-one defense against the teacher. resources, so this may be a more difficult multiple-choice question for the Heat. One way is to ""late assist defense"" and interfere with the teacher at the moment the teacher is asked to take action, but this may require you to have a person who is enough to interfere with the teacher. A mobile forward, which is also a resource that the Heat do not have.

4.91E+15,N3owxe41Z,5857692425,Brother Ax_AGordon,"Nuggets legend Michael Malone was convinced after just three games that Gordon could write him in the NBA Finals. It was during this time that he began to believe Gordon was the Nuggets' missing piece. He came to this conclusion after the Nuggets defeated the fully healthy Clippers on April 1, 2021. This was Gordon's third game for the Nuggets after the trade deadline, when he came to the Nuggets from the Magic in exchange for Gary Harris, RJ Hampton and a future first-round pick. In the Nuggets' 101-94 victory, Gordon scored 14 points, 6 rebounds and 6 assists, but it was his 3 steals and defense of Leonard that gave Malone bigger ideas. Malone recalled that night two years ago, ""Gordon showed us in that moment that he can guard the one to five."" ""And did a good job at it."" ""That game still can. The reason it resonated was that we all felt like we had a real chance to win a championship that year if we stayed healthy. Of course, the Nuggets didn't stay healthy. 12 days later, Jamal Murray tore his ACL , the Nuggets' championship hopes were dashed. Denver's dreams of bringing home Larry O'Brien's trophy for the first time were put on hold. ""It kind of delayed our destiny a little bit,"" Malone said. But now the Nuggets are back Came back and made it to the NBA Finals for the first time. A key reason was the 2021 trade deadline trade, which seemed like the perfect fit when he arrived in Denver. Gordon's defense in the playoffs was outstanding. In In the first round, he defended Karl-Anthony Towns. In the second round, he blocked Durant. In the Western Conference Finals, Gordon attracted LeBron James. His main opponent in the Finals will be Jimmy Butler. They're both different types of matchups, and Gordon's defensive ability has been the Nuggets' go-to midfielder and center throughout the playoffs as he went from player to player. Jeff Green on Of Gordon: “He has a good understanding of who he’s tasked with guarding and also a good understanding of the team’s setup. “I thought he did a fantastic job. He is one of the reasons we are here. It starts with the defense, where he is a giant and he puts pressure on their key players. ""Butler just finished a seven-game Eastern Conference finals run against the Celtics, averaging 24.7 points, 7.6 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game. It's a completely different challenge for Gordon. He's not as good as Towns."" Big. He's not a scorer like Durant. He doesn't play with as much power as James. But Butler does a little bit of everything. ""Jimmy is probably the most well-rounded of these guys,"" Gordon said. Butt LeBron James is crafty. He's tricky. He'll keep you off balance and take advantage of you. Butler averaged 9.3 free throws per game, which is the second-most in the playoffs behind Giannis Antetokounmpo. He's very good without the ball. Active. He can help when the Heat need offense. He has a strong feel right now. He is the clutch. He is a great shooter and can stay calm in the tightest moments of the game. He never loses control. Go ""Jimmy is a tough player to guard, unlike guys I've guarded in the past like Durant, LeBron and Towns,"" Deng said. “Jimmy does it all. He does all the invisible things. He breaks through on switches. He's sharp. He gets offensive rebounds. He has many offensive options. He gets a lot of free throws. He does a lot in the game and is very technically sound. He's a hard person to fake. Gordon has a lot of experience playing against Butler — 23 games to be exact — and that's mostly a result of the years he and Butler spent together in the East. In the Nuggets, Gordon and Butler have faced each other three times. Butler's stat lines in these games are as follows: April 14, 2021: 13 points (8-for-5 from the field), 3 rebounds, 9 assists November 8, 2021: 31 points (18-for-10 from the field), 5 rebounds, 8 assists December 30, 2022: 17 points (5-of-13 shooting), 6 rebounds, 8 assists Butler’s three-game average: 20.3 points (51.2% shooting), 4.7 rebounds, 8.3 assists Gordon should be a good matchup for Butler. I can't think of many better defensive players in the league than him. Gordon and Butler are about the same size. Gordon's physical fitness is also very good and can rival Butler's one-on-one strength. While Gordon has struggled guarding smaller, faster guards and wings, he's best at guarding players like Leonard and Luke Doncic. One area Gordon must maintain is Butler off the ball. Butler loves to sneak into easy baskets when the defense is out of position and defenders are asleep. Gordon did it all for the Nuggets in the playoffs. He accounted for only 8 percent of backup centers during the regular season, according to Basketball Reference, but he was Malone's only trusted option at the 5 when Nikola Jokic was off the court. Gordon is the linchpin of Denver's defensive scheme and the glue that holds the Nuggets defense together. If Gordon has another great series on the defensive end and the Nuggets win the championship, his legacy will be cemented. He will always be a Nugget, and that's because he did the dirty work. Because he made sacrifices. He was relentless on the defensive end, taking on the toughest defensive assignments in each series and the Nuggets won. ""If I can take on the task of guarding the best player day and night and make it easier for the guys around me so they can focus on their job, then so be it,"" Gordon said.

Warriors rookie Jordan Hawkins is 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 185 pounds. He is tall and light for a shooting guard. Hawkins averaged 157 points per game at the University of Connecticut this season and shot 405% from the field. The field goal percentage was 383%, averaging 75 times per game, and the free throw percentage was 884%, averaging 35 times per game. His three-point field goal percentage and free throw percentage ranked second in the Big East League. Hawkins is a mobile shooter and has The ability to make difficult and strong shots, and he is very smart and disciplined on both offense and defense. He is very suitable for playing in the Warriors system. Hawkins's weakness is that although he is an excellent shooter, other than that, he will not contribute to the team. The offense provides too much help. He has a good long-range shooting ability, but relies heavily on his right hand, which weakens the impact of scoring. Nonetheless, Hawkins still has the standard size of a shooting guard and a quick first step, so his body The hardware allows him to make some plays off the dribble. Additionally, Hawkins moves very well off the ball. Three-point shooting is a skill that translates directly to the NBA, as does his ability to create space for himself by utilizing screens. In fact, Hawkins has a very Stephen Curry-like style of play, with lightning-quick release, long range, confidence and tough shooting ability. Hawkins is a smart and dynamic defender. , he knows how to use his height advantage, whether it's steals or blocks, and he has the obvious ability to make an impact on the defensive end. In the NBA, especially with the Warriors, defense is often the key to early success as a rookie. Hawkins will need to continue to make an impact on the defensive end. Use his length and strength to make an impact. Hawkins is expected to play a 3-and-D role first on any team, and his rookie season should see him shoot respectable shots from beyond the arc and guard two. In the backcourt position, he has tripled his points and almost doubled his assists this season. Due to his gradually increasing passing ability, Hawkins can also have the opportunity to slowly grow into a combo guard and even become the team's first choice. Hawkins, the secondary organizational point, is a pick that the Warriors may hope to get (Hawkins' pick will rise due to UConn winning the championship). There is not much problem in selecting Hawkins for shooting. The risk lies in whether the height of the joint training will shrink. If the height If he is qualified, he may even be promoted to the 3rd position. The shrinkage in height will reduce the value. In theory, he is very consistent with Cole's ideal type and can be matched with anyone. However, if they want to select him, the Warriors first need to streamline the backcourt personnel because of Poole.

4.91E+15,N2G4TgAsC,1910321645,West Point Coco West,"After sending out the 2k-word ""Quan"", I didn't expect Nikay to achieve such a result. In terms of the game, a lot of mistakes were made during the period. 82:83 was the first time we fell behind since the first quarter. Then Jaylen scored 2+1+1, was fouled again on a fast break counterattack, and made 2 free throws. Nitu caused another shooting foul. The score came to 90:83. Then Ah Gang made up for the slow guy, missed Dun Luo, and hit a 3-pointer. In fact, in this round, you can completely let the teammates behind you cover up the defense. You can never let go of the opponent's 3-point shooter. This is how you lost the first three games. Nikai made a beautiful cooperation, and Nitu succeeded in a layup. This was Nitu's only sports goal in the second half. Then A Gang was afraid of Dun Luo's reverse run and actually let him go for a layup. At this time, Nikay still led by 4 points. Then Bai Di went around the screen and made a 3-pointer. Then A Gang scored And1 again. In fact, Agang is quite confident in playing the opposing guard, as long as he doesn't choose to shoot 3-pointers. Nikay led by 10 points at 98:88. I really thought that Nikay could go home in peace. But Butler's explosive power is still underestimated. Ah Gang may have discovered that the opponent was chasing him. After Dun Luo and Vincent's baseline cover, he decisively used Jaylen, who was physically strong, to chase. Ah Gang chased Vincent. Sure enough, Dun Luo had no chance to take a shot, and the Heat's patience allowed them to find Vincent who loved to assist defense and was missed by Agang. Fortunately, he missed 3 points. Azu also rarely called the penultimate timeout after Nitu chose a simple side step for 3 points. But this timeout, which was insignificant to Nikay, was good news for the Heat, who were 10 points behind and needed to adjust, because Spoelstra only had one timeout left. After returning to play the entire attack time, Ah Gang barely made a shot. Butler began his penalty blast. In fact, according to the scale of Butler's foul, several of Nikay's balls could have sounded the whistle. Butler made 10 free throws in the last quarter, but he only made 4 free throws in the first three quarters. The Heat also found a breakthrough in offense. Like last year's Warriors, the pace was slow. Later, Nikay missed a free throw rebound, and Jaylen failed to find his defender and was caught on a fast break, allowing Dun Luo to shoot a three-pointer. If these two goals scored, Nikay would be really cool. Let’s talk about the last round. The Heat knew that Nikay was going to give the ball to Nitu. Even though Nitu was 1/9 in the second half and 0/8 from 3 points in the game, the Winter Soldier immediately chose to double-team Nitu. As expected, the ball was served to everyone. The person the team most wants the ball in is in the hands of A Gang. In the last round against the 76ers, Agang had the experience of not taking a shot once the time expired. In fact, 3 seconds is enough to make a few dribbles, or pass the ball again before taking a shot, but maybe Agang or Azu only thought of the last chance. Will he do the opposite to Agang and go directly to grab the board? In order to prevent Nitu from catching the ball, the Winter Soldier missed White, allowing him to make a tip-in for the game-winner. In fact, Nitu also rushed to the right side of the backboard, which means that both sides are protected. I don’t know if it’s Azu’s strategy or just the player’s sense of rebounding. During this timeout, my mind recalled the scene in G7 of the Eastern Conference Finals last season when Agang played consecutive singles and the Heat continued to chase points. In the second half of the journey, my hands were all sweaty, and my heart felt very cold. Are the Heat really going to collapse? Fortunately, White didn't let it happen. In fact, in the last 5 minutes, starting from the timeout when the team was leading by 10 points, Nikay's technical, tactical and competitive state had completely fallen behind. This also led to the experience of being overturned after leading by 10+ points many times. I really hope Nikay can be more stable at critical moments and at the end of the game. Finally, in G7, both sides have reached a time to decide the outcome. I hope Nikay will continue his efforts and create history.

4.91E+15,N2FzCvXfk,7718431367,Gu Yifei,"Gu Yifei [#heatproblem#] At the last moment, the balance of victory flipped back and forth between the Heat and the Celtics. First, Butler caused a three-point foul against Horford, made all three free throws, and went ahead by one point, leaving him with Celtics 3 seconds. After the timeout, Boston sent the ball forward and Smart hurriedly caught the ball and missed a three-pointer. Just when everyone thought the game was over, Whitey rushed out from the corner and scored a tip-in against the defense at the buzzer. The referee looked back and found that the two points were valid and the Celtics successfully tied the game! Throughout the game, the Celtics were the better team overall. They maintained a good lead in the first three quarters and restricted Butler. Ten points were in place, allowing the latter to score only 11 points in the first three quarters. On the other hand, the Heat's shooters were all inaccurate in the final quarter. Dun Luo, who had been extremely efficient before, slipped up at a critical moment and hit two consecutive three-pointers. Fortunately, Teacher Jimmy, who had been silent for a whole game, finally stood up and narrowed the point difference with continuous singles and mid-range attacks. Leaving the Heat for the last attack, Spoelstra did not call a timeout and tacitly left the fate of the game to Butler to decide. Butler did exactly that. Facing a two-point deficit in the end, he defied Horford's defense and made a determined three-pointer and successfully won three free throws, leading by one point. Eliminating the opponent or continuing to overtime, Jimmy chose the former without hesitation. Just like he chose to shoot a key three-pointer at the last moment in last year's Eastern Conference Finals, Butler never hesitated when faced with opportunities. Unexpectedly, luck favored the Celtics who were on the verge of elimination this time... After the tiebreaker, they returned to the North Shore Garden. With their overall momentum and physical strength lagging behind, it may be difficult for the Heat to advance. If the Celtics The Celtics successfully reversed and won the tiebreaker, which will also break the precedent in NBA history that no team that fell behind 0-3 in a series failed to advance~ #飞义NBA##超元星计划#",,,,What's wrong with the Heat?

4.91E+15,N2FrExJRd,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"White's buzzer-beating goal can rival Fisher's 0.4 seconds against the Spurs. It can almost be ranked as a legend in the history of the Celtics with ""Havlicek steals the ball"" and ""Bird steals the assassin"". If the Celtics really complete the first major comeback from a 0-3 deficit in history, unless something happens in Game 7, this scene will be one of the most legendary stories in NBA history, and will be shown in various legendary scenes later. Replay in. We just witnessed history. The last shot: Jimmy Butler is chasing Tatum, Adebayo is chasing Jaylen, Vincent is chasing Smart, and Martin is watching Horford. Vincent followed Smart's shot, Adebayor was not cut open by Jaylen, and even blocked Jaylen's attempt to steal an offensive rebound. Jimmy did not let Tatum catch the ball. Every aspect is correct. Struth turned his back to White and stared at Tatum. He did nothing wrong. With only 3 seconds, he had to give priority to helping Jimmy take care of Tatum. It was this that turned his back to White and blocked Tatum, allowing White to slip to the baseline. Hit the offensive rebound. 0.3 seconds to kill. ——The moment of White's buzzer-beater was like a microcosm of the entire game: he and Tatum both took off and pounced on the front rebound, trying to score a missed three-pointer. After guarding the three-point line for a whole game, he ended up losing backcourt rebounds - more than one. Be willing to admit defeat. Jaylen's rhetoric after the game was gorgeous: ""Derrick White flew out of thin air like a bolt of lightning and saved the day!"" The Celtics had lost two games in a row, relying on three-pointers and Horford switching to guard Jimmy and Rowe. Delay Jimmy, delay the double attack - wait until Jimmy and Adebayo dribble before double attack, White sticks to Jimmy's bottom plate, and does not jump. Coach Spoelstra followed suit today: in addition to blocking Tatum, he switched defenses and expanded the three-pointer. Only White and Smart scored three-pointers for the Celtics, and all others missed - the two Jays combined to make 17 of 26 two-pointers and 0 of 12 three-pointers. But the Celtics' defense was a little bit crazy: in order to contain Jimmy and Adebayor, they let in more than one three-pointer from the top of the arc from Dunloe and Struss. On the other side, Tatum scored 25 points in the first half. But in the second half, the game got hotter: not only did they delay the attack and return to position, Martin/Jimmy/Strus basically stayed with him, cutting off the Celtics from passing the ball to him. So the counterattack began. In the fourth quarter, the Heat already understood the Celtics' defense change, so Dun Luo took the initiative to change defense and let Adebayor beat Smart, 74 to 79. Dunron cut inside and beat White, 76 to 79. Lowry misplaced his shot at Jaylen, Dunroe misplaced his shot at Horford, and Jimmy took advantage of Dunroe's inside shot to score an offensive rebound. Hot one breath lead 83 to 82. Then Jaylen, Smart and White took advantage of the Heat's defense switch to take a 9-point lead. In the last minute, Jaylen cut inside and hit the offensive rebound for a free throw - which actually reminded Coach Spoelstra: Lock it up. To catch the Celtics' three-pointers, you also have to be careful about backcourt rebounds. But it’s a dilemma. Then Tatum stumbled into the crowd and missed a layup, grabbed an offensive rebound and was blocked by Adebayor; Jimmy continued to get free throws at the last moment, with the last 3 seconds remaining. The rest is history. how to say? In the last 1 minute and 01 seconds, the Celtics grabbed 3 offensive rebounds. In the last 4 minutes, the Celtics grabbed 5 offensive rebounds. The Celtics grabbed 6 offensive rebounds in the first three quarters. In the last quarter, the Celtics made 2 of 10 three-pointers and grabbed 6 offensive rebounds. Now re-watching the last 3 seconds, everyone in the Heat actually worked hard: they locked Smart's three-pointer and didn't let Tatum catch the ball outside the three-point line. Adebayor had time to stop Jaylen from rushing forward. There was a rebound attempt, but in the end, White and Tatum both took off and rushed to the frontcourt rebound. Be willing to admit defeat. In the first quarter, Jaylen punished the Heat's defense with a strong attack. In the second quarter, Tatum swept 16 points to widen the gap. In the fourth quarter, Jimmy, who shut down the whole game, scored 15 points alone - the two major players combined for 13 points - and was about to save his reputation and the entire series, and then White gave a buzzer beater. Change the angle. Today is Tatum's fourth 30+ game in six games. This should be the first time in his career that he has 30+ points in four games in a single series. Jaylen played his first high-shooting game in 19 days - 9 of 16 shots from the field and 8 of 10 free throws. Previously, he shot less than 50% in six consecutive games and 9 of 18 in the last game - as well as his career. A playoff-high 5 offensive rebounds. But White was the man of the match. Not only because he hit the buzzer-beating shot, but also because Jimmy Butler, who scored 47 points in Game 6 last year at Miami's home court, missed 8 of the 16 shots he missed today. Also includes a cover. As mentioned before, against a pace monster like Jimmy, you have to have someone who is stable on the ground and not shaky to defend with his feet. The Celtics have found a way in these games: prevent Jimmy from rushing up and taking advantage of the opportunity to seize the position. Without allowing Jimmy to comfortably take mid-range shots and not easily take off, Jimmy still had to take a lot of free throws today, but he really couldn't make them. White had a game-high 3 blocks. An offensive rebound kills the game. A team-high 13 shot interference attempts. ——This is not what a person who is 193 cm tall should do. Not everyone remembers this: This time last year, in Game 6 of the Heat's game against the Celtics, Jimmy scored 47 points. In fact, White wanted to win the most that day: White scored 10 points in the fourth quarter, briefly giving the Celtics the lead—and then was taken away by a wave of heat. Today, White defended Jimmy and allowed him to make 5 of 21 shots. He completed the buzzer beater and won the sixth game. In one year, one stone kills the enemy. A little earlier, what was the most famous Game 6 that took place at this stadium? As we all know: In Game 6 of the 2013 Finals, the Heat, who were trailing 3-2, relied on former Celtics sharpshooter Ray Allen's long shot against the Spurs to tie the game at 3-3. Ten years later, the Celtics, who were trailing 2-3, relied on White's buzzer-beater to defeat the Heat in Game 6 and tied the game 3-3. ——What a coincidence, Derrick White is from the San Antonio Spurs. That is: the Spurs that were defeated by former Celtics shooter Ray Allen in Game 6 of the Miami Heat and a 0.4-second buzzer beater by Fisher. He stepped out as a defender and put on a Celtics jersey. In the sixth game, he scored a 0.3-second buzzer-beater. (If you observe carefully, you will find that when Ray Allen shot that three-pointer, Parker who was guarding him was Spurs No. 9; who is White who hit the buzzer beater today? Celtics No. 9...)

4.91E+15,N2xupsR3w,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"#Pippen said Jordan was a bad teammate# If Pippen had said this about Jordan when he first retired, more people would have believed him. But in the past few years, after he has made various overt and covert attacks on Jordan, everyone will probably discount what he said about Jordan - in this regard, he is almost on par with the assassins. Pippen said that when he came to the Bulls, Jordan ""Hewasahorribleplayer,hewashorribletoplaywith"". ——Jordan won the championship with a buzzer beater as a freshman in 1982, swept all the best awards in the United States as a junior, led the United States to win the Olympics, averaged 28+7+6 per game as a freshman in the NBA, shot 52% from the field, and ranked first in the league in total points in a single season. In his second year, he was injured and only played 18 games. Then in the playoffs against the 1986 Celtics, one of the greatest teams in history, he scored 49 points in the first game and a record-breaking 63 points in the second game. Bird said, ""God wears it."" It’s the 23rd.” As a junior, he averaged 37 points per game and won the scoring title, averaging 37+5+5 per game, as well as 2.9 steals and 1.5 blocks. Second only to Magic in MVP votes. From 1975 to 1984, the Bulls made two playoff appearances. In the first three years of Jordan's career, the Bulls made three playoff appearances. Talking about a player who was second in the MVP vote, Bird said God wore No. 23, Magic said ""the whole league is divided into two groups of people: Michael and others"", and he was a horrible player - I always feel that Pippen was scolding the entire NBA at that time. ...Of course, Pippen's point is probably that Jordan was not a good teammate at the time, he was terrible to play with. In this regard, Bird happened to also say this in 1987. In 1987, Bird said: ""I don't like to see the same player shooting every ball. Basketball shouldn't be like this."" Jordan's answer: ""I don't have a bunch of great teammates around the league. Magic has talent around him. Gou and Worthy, Bird has Dennis Johnson and McHale next to him."" Jordan studied at North Carolina University and was the third player on the team when they won the championship as a freshman in 1982. In the first grade, he took 20 shots per game and scored 28 points. He ranked third on the team in true shooting percentage. The one with a higher true shooting percentage than him is a famous black hole. Orlando·""I have to run to the sideline to look at my own data from time to time""·Ulrich , one is dunk machine Steve Johnson. Not to mention the sophomore injury. The third-year Jordan is surrounded by: blue-collar Okali, John Paxson, the prototype of fixed-point shooter Mu Mu, center Kozny (shooting rate 48%) who is not very successful, injured Cureton and the new Come on Cyrus. ——Except for Okali who shone next to Ewing and Paxson who won three rings with Jordan, all of these people were lost in NBA history. Sellers played 26 of his 28 career playoff games with Jordan; Kozny played 36 of his 68 career playoff games with Jordan. Bird is surrounded by DJ and McHale, Magic is surrounded by Skyhook and Worthy, and Jordan is surrounded by these guys. Well, entering Pippen's rookie year. He played 79 games, all as a substitute, with 8 points, 4 rebounds and 2 assists in 21 minutes per game. What was the situation with the Bulls that year? Okali + Sellers twin towers, the team even put up a three tower of Okali + Sellers + Kozny. The only players available in the backcourt are Vincent - who missed 53 games - and Paxson. It's such a top-heavy weird formation. As a result, this season, the Bulls won 50 games. Jordan averaged 35+6+6 per game throughout the year, as well as 3.2 steals and 1.6 blocks. He is the team's leading scorer, assists leader, steal leader, and shot blocker (for a guard!). So Defensive Player of the Year + Scoring Champion + Regular Season MVP. How difficult is it for a team to win 50 games with a shooting guard who is missing most of the season and has to start in three towers? With one shooting guard leading the team in scoring, steals, assists, and blocks, it can win 50 games? hewashorribletoplaywith--Then how did the team win 50 games? Game 5 against the Cavaliers in the playoffs that year was Pippen's famous game. Pippen scored 24 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists and 3 steals that day. But in the playoffs that year, do you know how Jordan came here? In the first game against the Cavaliers, Jordan scored 50 points. In the second game, 55 points. 38 points in the third game, 44 points in the fourth game, and 39 points in the fifth game. So after Pippen played in Game 5, Jordan was happier than anyone else. ""The coach has been working hard to make the team not rely too much on me. In our offense, everyone has an equal opportunity to score. But sometimes others are just not used to taking over. We need more teammates to step up."" Now we know that we are no longer a one-man team."" After that, Pippen gradually took over the Bulls' ball rights, and even became the Bulls' chief ball handler and the starter of the triangle offense in the 1990-91 season. ——On the eve of the 1990-91 season, what did Pippen do? In Game 7 of the 1990 Eastern Conference Finals, the Bulls, who were expected to win the championship after passing the Pistons, were ruined by Pippen's famous migraine in Game 7 of 1-for-10 shooting. Of course, around 1990, Jordan's playing style underwent huge adjustments. But Pippen said Jordan ""Hewasahorribleplayer,hewashorribletoplaywith"". What it means: Winning a championship as a member of a college team, finishing second in NBA regular season MVP votes in 1987, being the regular season MVP the next year, leading a team with a paralyzed lineup and backcourt injuries to reach 50 wins, Scoring champion + defensive player of the year + team's assists and blocks leader, and will slowly transfer the ball rights to Pippen (who has never proven himself). This guy is a bad player and a bad teammate. . It always feels like... mocking the entire NBA at that time? By the way, old Bulls fans will remember these two things. In Game 3 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls needed a buzzer beater at the last moment against the Knicks. Jackson asked Pippen to serve from the sideline to Kukoc for a shot. Pippen felt that his self-esteem had been hit, and angrily refused to play and refused to dress for Kukoc. Pippen was a very team player, but occasionally his self-esteem and self-esteem were involved. When he feels safe, he can easily go to extremes and even abandon the entire team. As a result, Kukoc hit the buzzer-beater and the Bulls won. Three years later, Jordan took the initiative to pass the ball to the open substitute shooter Cole at the last moment of Game 6 of the Finals. Cole hit the key mid-range shot and the Bulls won their fifth championship. Horrible to play with, huh?",,,,Pippen said Jordan was a terrible teammate,79,154,852,5/27/23 16:57,Weibo web version,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hed1m8h2mcj3069098wem.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hed1ma3llgj30m80f0q7z.jpg']",,

4.91E+15,N2tPYD87o,2477224377,Find someone you can rely on_196,"#体育##NBA# Today the Heat and the Celtics usher in the fifth game. With Tatum’s wonderful performance in the fourth game, the Celtics continue to retain the hope of reversal. Sitting at home today, they will face Come to the Heat's away challenge. Before the start of today's game, it was reported that Vincent, the dark horse scorer of this year's playoff team, would miss the game. This is undoubtedly a loss for the Heat. Sure enough, the Heat were knocked down by the Celtics' offensive in the opening game. The Heat started with a flurry and were unable to fight back. Both the Heat and Butler ushered in the lowest score in this series. Butler After only scoring 14 points, the Heat eventually lost to the Celtics 97-110, and the total score was tied at 2-3. If the Heat fail to maintain their home victory in the next round, they will play an away game tiebreaker. First, the Heat suffered heavy losses on the outside again, and the Heat's offense had no strong scoring points! Although Butler has performed exceptionally well many times this year, without the support of other players on the team, it would be difficult for the Heat to get to where they are today. The team's shooters such as Vincent and Martin make the team's offense smoother, and at the same time allow the Heat to continue to maintain offensive firepower from the outside. But now Vincent was injured in the last game, which undoubtedly caused a heavy blow to the Heat's outside line. In this game, the Heat only hit 9 three-pointers, while the opponent Celtics hit 16 three-pointers. The inaccuracy on the outside will undoubtedly increase the pressure on the Heat's inside offense, and the opponent will use this to narrow the defensive area and let the opponent be less good at it. Butler on the outside can't open up the offense on the inside. At the same time, the opponent will boldly adopt double-team tactics to test the Heat's outside shooting. It can be seen from the data that the Heat made 16 mistakes today and Butler's offense is no longer decisive. This is all due to the team's lack of offensive firepower and no offensive strong points except himself. Second, the defensive end moves slowly, and the Celtics obviously have the advantage of speed. Although both teams can play unlimited defense changes, the Heat obviously cannot keep up with the Celtics in speed. Because the Heat have older players like Love and Lowry, and although Adebayor is more flexible at the 4th position, he is not as fast as the Celtics defenders and forwards, and Love himself is The defensive loopholes, if he and Adebayor are on the court at the same time, the Celtics can constantly attack the Heat through pick-and-rolls and mid- and long-range attacks, making them pay for the defense. If Tatum and Brown work together, it may be difficult for the Heat to keep up with them. At the beginning of today's game, the Celtics were obviously more prepared. They took away the game with a 20-5 opening wave, setting the tone for this game. Constant defensive counterattacks will cause the Heat's inside line to be exhausted prematurely and appear to be weak defensively. ring. The Celtics do not have such a problem. Except for Horford, their first starters have strong impact and speed. They can make up for Horford's possible leaks through defense. Although the substitute Williams is an inside player, His movement speed is not weaker than that of other forward players, so their lineup advantage is also reflected in this. Third, the Celtics themselves are a team with home court advantage in the playoffs. Once the game enters the tiebreaker, this will be extremely detrimental to the Heat. You must know that no team in NBA history can win 0-0. 3. After being reversed from behind, if they lose another game, they are likely to be defeated by a strong psychological burden. At that time, the Celtics were already on the same starting line as them, and were superior to the Heat in terms of the completeness of the lineup, the team's own hard power, and scoring points. At that time, it would be difficult for the Heat to win on the road. So this game seems to be only the fifth game, but its influence is no less than the battle of Tianwangshan, and this will also be the last straw that may overwhelm the Heat! Now that the big score has been tied to 2-3, there may not be much time left for the Heat. But facing the team's current lineup shortcomings and injuries, even Coach Spoelstra may not be able to make too many adjustments. The Celtics are becoming more and more courageous as they fight. Originally, the Celtics seemed to have given up on this series, but now when hope appears in front of them again, I believe everyone on the team will work hard to complete the reversal and create history. . The awakening of Tatum, the core of the team, is the top priority for them to win the game. When a team can hit more than 15 three-pointers with a high shooting percentage every game, it's hard to believe that they will be defeated by other teams.

""The guy I like out of the recent names that have been brought up is Fred VanVleet, he's a free agent, and I like him. One, he doesn't have to have the ball in his hands. Him and Kyle -Lowry has played ball, so he doesn't need to handle the ball. Pascal Siakam also handled the ball a lot in Toronto. He will also have some handles, but he does not need a lot of ball possession. He is as tough as nails, No need to say anything. He's a very tough player, he's got a championship pedigree, he knows what it takes to be a 16-game playoff player, he can knock down threes, he's a pretty good shooter."" Defensively, even though he's not tall, he's very thick. If they can find a way to do it, if I had to pick one of the three, Kyrie (Irving) has the highest ceiling, but his lack of reliability cannot be ignored. If I had to choose one of these three, I would choose VanVleet. Because I think even if he is not an offensive genius like Kyrie, his defense is much better, and he is more suitable for this role, even if his salary will be much higher than the average role player, because he is not a role player, he is a real role player.

Generally speaking, a qualified shooter in the NBA will hit more than 30% or 35% of his three-pointers. Above, excellent shooters, more than 40%, sharpshooters look pretty good, right, but those are the numbers shot in the extremely strong physical confrontation of the NBA. To achieve a qualified shooting percentage, the shooting practice shooting percentage will not be lower than 90% and this is a number based on a large number of shots. In other words, if you shoot 100 balls in a row, you will not miss more than 10 shots. On the other hand, we can also say how terrible NBA confrontation is.

As a result, he became the third player in NBA history to achieve at least 500 points, 200 rebounds and 150 assists in a single playoff. The two are James (done it 4 times: 2015-18, 2020) and Bird (did it once: 1987). But it is worth mentioning that this is the third time that Teacher Yue has scored 40+ in this year's playoffs.

4.91E+15,N2706rZ0N,5533010788,Love Spurs,"[2023 # Spurs Draft # Observation] Ignite French 19-year-old Sidi Sissoko’s highlights of the game Name: Sidi Sissoko Height: 203 cm Weight: 94 kg Wingspan: 204 cm Birthday: April 2004 Position on March 2: Shooting guard/small forward From: France/G League Ignite Team Predicted pick: Late first round/early second round Player introduction (from website: NBADRAFT) 6-foot-7 who played for the LEBGOLD League IraurgiSB team last season Striker Sidi Sissoko joined the Development League's Ignite team this season and partnered with Henderson to enter the NBA. After delivering a few raucous passes in Nike's top game, the lanky ball-handler attracted attention with his excellent intelligence and selfless style. Offensively, Sidi Sissoko didn't do much. He is not a stable shooter and there is still room for improvement in shooting. His shooting seems to be very flat, and he often misses, but fortunately, the overall shooting is smooth, and he dares to shoot three-pointers from fixed spots. He has good body shape and athletic ability. He is 6-7 tall and has a very strong lower body. He can hit the basket with long strides and even European steps. However, his finishing touch and skills are average, and he only has unstable layups and throws. Although he dares to confront, his movements after the confrontation are often severely deformed, and his efficiency is greatly reduced. And sometimes, he has a tendency not to attack, preferring to give the ball to better teammates. But sometimes, he has poor shot selection, making some outrageous strong shots and chasing three-pointers. He still needs to improve in handling the ball. Many times, he relies on cuts and fixed-point shots without the ball to score points. What Sidi is most talked about is his cool passing and excellent vision. Although in LEB, his turnover rate is not low and he dares to pass some bold transfers, but he has excellent vision and selflessness. His style of play is very comfortable in the pick and roll. When breaking through and distributing the ball, he can find cutters and spot-up shooters, and he can also quickly get the ball to the big man down the line. He can also deliver hidden back passes and ground balls on the move, and deliver accurate wide-area transfers when his vision is wide. After stealing the ball, he can also get the ball to his teammates who are about to leave in time. Generally speaking, he is very good at finding opportunities while moving. He has the ability to move the ball in a wide range with beautiful and decisive hands, and can connect the team well. As for the defensive end, Sissoko is a tough and active defender, has excellent rebounding ability at the same position, and dares to block opponents to grab rebounds. At the same time, he will fiercely fight for offensive rebounds and protect backcourt rebounds, and he will help defend the basket at any time, prepare to protect the frame and block shots; and his pair of fast hands can constantly harass opponents, frequently put pressure on the ball carrier, and intercept Passing lanes. His enthusiasm and anticipation are good, but he will also be out of position due to excessive attention to the ball holder, and he needs to continue to improve his experience. This big French defender has good athletic ability. Although his scoring skills are rough, he can still score points with his enthusiasm and fighting ability. His offensive ability with the ball is not very stable. When facing multiple defenders, his movements are deformed and the ball is unstable. More often, he still relies on air cuts and transitions. And his broad vision, selfless style of play and active defense are rare for the Ignite team in recent years. He's expected to make a difference in a league where resources tend to focus solely on ball handlers. (Original text from: Tiger Fight Forum King DJ Wagner) Cissoko is a powerful swingman, standing 6 feet 7 inches tall, who combines strength, court vision and defensive potential. He is a late-blooming player, and it was not until he won the 2021 U18 European Basketball Championship with the team that he gradually gained attention from the outside world. Cissoko had many bright moments when he represented the Baskonia team in the Spanish second-tier league. At just 17 years old, he competed against a large number of adults and scored at least 16 points 8 times. Cissoko's athletic ability is amazing and he often performs high-altitude operations in the Spanish league. However, his explosive lateral movement does not seem to be as quick as when he was at his peak at Nike. However, his lack of movement control skills and fake movements make it difficult for him to create scoring opportunities on his own. However, if seen as the kind of organizational wing who does not need to hold the ball too much, Cissoko still has an attractive prospect. His size is a bit like RJ Barrett at the same age, and he can defend the opponent's wing (even the 4th player in a small-ball lineup) when he goes all out. At present, he does not have stable shooting ability. According to statistics, he has taken 170 three-pointers in his career and his shooting rate is only 26%. If Cissoko can continue to hit spot-up three-pointers against fierce opponents, he will have more opportunities to serve as the team's offensive organizer and use his athleticism and court vision to a greater extent, as we saw at the Nike Peak Game. That way. Cissoko's energy and vitality on the defensive end was far greater than in the Spanish second-tier league. In a total of 23 minutes of playing time, he scored 3 steals and 1 block, and had many pass assists without looking at anyone. wonderful performance. He's able to initiate pick-and-roll plays and effectively get the ball to open spots on the other side of the floor, although his judgment can sometimes appear too bold and haphazard. Generally speaking, Cissoko is still establishing and exploring his position on the court, but this French Senegalese young man has an excellent talent foundation and should make full use of his size, strength, defensive skills and organizational potential to enter the game. ——ESPN Schmitz June 23, 2022 # San Antonio Spurs # #超话creation officer #O web link",,,,"Spurs draft, San Antonio Spurs, super talk creative officer",3,11,46,5/24/23 21:31,NBA Super Talk,,,

In today's Western Conference finals, the Lakers lost to the Nuggets 111-113 at home and were eliminated with a score of 0-4. In this game, Lakers guard Austin Reeves played 41 minutes, made 6 of 11 shots, and scored 17 points, 2 rebounds and 3 assists. After the game, he accepted an interview with reporters. ""I've said it many times, we play basketball for a living and never take anything for granted because we've been through hard times,"" Reeves said. ""Obviously right now, it feels bad, but you can't take it for granted. I just finished playing in the Western Conference Finals. If you told me when I was 15 years old that I could play in the Western Conference Finals, I would have been like hell."" ""As a competitor, you never think about what you can't do. You always Everyone will believe it. Even before the trade deadline, we always felt that as long as we can find the state, we can launch a sprint. But then we made a trade and introduced a group of people whose skills and attitude are very suitable for the team. The Western Conference Finals is Things I never thought I could do before I entered the NBA."" ""As a competitor, obviously I want to get back on this stage and go further and win a championship, because according to LeBron (James), AD (Anthony Davis) communication, nothing feels better than this. So hopefully one day I can experience this feeling."" Speaking of the Nuggets, Reeves said: ""They are really good. They are a very, very, very good basketball team. There are no holes in their system, no shortcomings. They have two cores, Jamal (Murray) and (Nikola) Jokic. And then, if You have to build a team based on a system and combination perspective, so you have a cutter (Aaron) Gordon, and then you have a group of shooters. And then there are players who do dirty work but are not dirty, Bruce Brown , Jeff Green, and then looking at their bench, overall it's a really good team. In the four games of this series, they are the better team, I I wish them all the best."" Talking about what he hopes to improve in the summer, Reeves said: ""I am open to everything. If you tell me I need to work on dribbling, shooting, passing, defense, I am open to it. Be open-minded. So, first of all, take care of my body. This is the most games I've ever played in a season in my life.

4.90E+15,N1TUpcZNR,7762399751,SEPIAS-Daily Ball Blind Essence,"Let’s talk about the contract renewal issues of the Lakers’ free agents. Rivers' market value should be around 20 million. His lack of physical talent makes it difficult for him to serve as the first main attacker for a long time, and his potential to increase production is limited. But he can shoot at fixed points and break out, and his free throws are great, and his shooting seems to be sustainable; he has grasped the slight position advantage after the opponent closes out, and is excellent at mid-range operations and free throws, and his passing and control are also online. He has good discipline on the defensive end. He is a below-average but not a bad defender. Overall, he is a plug-and-play supporting player. In my opinion, even if someone offers a slightly higher salary, the Lakers will just match it without thinking. After all, Rivers has proven himself in the playoffs, and a small premium is acceptable. Rui Hachimura is the person most likely to cause the team to make mistakes. His positioning on the defensive end is awkward, he cannot defend the perimeter alone, and he is not good at assisting defense. His strength in the low post is indeed good, but in fact, except for this series, this skill is rarely used. On the offensive end, his three-point shooting in the playoffs was exceptional, but throughout his career he was an unqualified spot-up shooter. His main attack relies on the mid-range, but his efficiency is only over 40%. You must know that in today's NBA, the mid-range shooting rate must be at least more than 50% to qualify as a regular main attack method. Overall, he should be at the mid-level level. If the Lakers give him a big contract because of his strengths and avoidance of weaknesses under the specific circumstances of the playoffs, plus an extraordinary three-pointer, it will cause significant damage to the team's long-term finances. Russell is a difficult player to evaluate. With his per-year unit time level in the regular season and the scarce status of pick-and-roll players, his current salary is reasonable. But he will take a big dive every playoffs, and coupled with his poor attendance record, it's hard to say how much he is worth. Given that the signing and exchange will face a hard cap problem, and the pick-and-roll player is a scarce resource after all, and the market price is likely not to be low, the possibility of him leaving the team freely is quite high. Of course, the final result will depend on the market conditions.",,,,,2,11,21,5/23/23 12:12,Weibo web version,,,

4.90E+15,N1Req2xKr,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"Anthony Announces Retirement # Let’s talk about it seriously: Carmelo Melo Anthony. To sum up his career, what would it be? He has no championship, no first team of the year, and no MVP. He can score a lot. Few people can score better than him. 28,289 points in NBA career, ninth in history. In front is Shark, behind is Moses Malone. Second among small forwards in history. Before Klay Thompson set a record of 37 points in a single quarter, Melo tied the record for points scored in a single quarter: 33 points in a single quarter in the 2008-09 season. Whether it's total points or burst points, he's perfect. Any player ranking ninth in total points in the vast history of the NBA is an outstanding achievement. But Melo is probably rare, ""Oh, he scored so many...but it's a pity, he could have played a little better..."" In the first fourteen years of history, he was the only one who had neither a championship nor a MVP. The fifteenth is: Dominic Wilkins. He is not very willing to pass the ball or defend, but he is really good at scoring and playing well. ——In fact, in the 1980s, there were many No. 3 players: Bernard King, Wilkins, Dantley, Aguirre, including Melo’s own Nuggets legends English and Vandeweghe. Melon is the ultimate souped-up version of this group. He can really score, in a variety of ways - but only, it seems, scoring. What kind of beginning did Melon have? In high school, he came face to face with LeBron. Then he went to Syracuse University. As a freshman, he led the team in scoring and led Syracuse to the college championship. In the Final Four against Texas State, he scored 33 points, a college basketball freshman record. In the final against Kansas, he scored 20 points and 10 rebounds. As a newcomer, as the team's scoring leader, he won the national championship - Takehiko Inoue didn't even dare to draw Kaede Rukawa and lead Shohoku to win the championship, right? So he entered the 2003 draft because he had done everything in college and there was nothing left to pursue. ——A similar legend was completed by Anthony Davis in Kentucky in 2012. This is where his college basketball career begins and ends. A small thing that only those involved remember: We all remember that Kobe Bryant won the scoring title in the 2005-07 season, but in fact, in the first half of the 2006-07 season, Melo was leading the scoring list. He averaged 31 points per game before the All-Star Game that year. What happened next is well known: Kobe scored 50+ points in four consecutive games in March 2007, averaging 40 points per game in a single month, coming from behind. It doesn't matter: Fourth-year Melo, not yet 23 years old, is competing with Kobe Bryant for the scoring title in the NBA. This is his starting point in the NBA. He entered the industry quite smoothly. Compared with LeBron who did not enter the playoffs until his third year, Melo has not missed the playoffs since his rookie year. But... After losing the series against the Clippers in 2006, Melo said something unreasonable: ""I don't want to be like KG, who spent eight years to finally get through the first round."" In hindsight, it all clicked. prophecy. Melo is a scoring kaleidoscope, which has been described many times before: you may see him shooting three-pointers in fast breaks; you may see him holding the ball at the three-point line and changing direction to break through the basket; you may see him sticking his butt on his left waist He gets in position to catch the ball, turns around and uses a tentative step, and then makes a mid-range shot or breakthrough; you may also see him raise his butt on his right waist, get in position to catch the ball, and push his big butt all the way to the basket for a fadeaway shot. You may see him suddenly accelerate around the screen in the left corner, catch the ball and hit a mid-range shot; you may also see him play pick-and-roll with defenders, cut out, and catch the ball in the open space. He can roam without the ball and post up in the low post. He can attack from the three-point line facing the basket. Melo likes to hold the ball in the waist positions of the left and right penalty areas. His big ass ensures he can easily reach the balls there. After receiving the ball with his back, Melo will do a cool Sikma step, turn around to face the basket, and then he will stretch out his right foot and take a tentative step. This thing is his unique skill, similar to the opening of a test question: ""Okay, now what do you think my next step will be?"" Stand still? He may break through along this tentative step. Melo doesn't have the speed of LeBron or Wade, but he's still not slow. Moreover, if you are stuck in position to overtake the car due to his broad shoulders and fat hips, you will never be able to overtake him again. Follow? He may use a reverse step to break through with his left hand. Take half a step back to create distance so that he can't break through? He can take advantage of the distance and jump right in front of you. After taking half a step back and watching him take a shot, you immediately pounce on him and shoot? He might just fake a shot and pass directly under your arm and pass. As early as 2003, when he was a freshman, Ian Thomson's scouting report said: ""His skills are enough for him to play multiple positions. He is best suited for the small forward because he can dribble, play fast break, Can shoot jumpers, but he's also big enough to play in the paint."" Imagine you're guarding him. Holding the ball, he takes a tentative step: When he takes a tentative step with his right foot, he will lean forward toward the opponent's left side with his whole body. Do you react? If you don't react, he will break through your left shoulder directly. You retreat and he hits the shot. You move to the left, Melon retracts his right foot, exerts force, and breaks through with his left hand. When Melon was at his peak, his first step was fierce, because firstly, he often followed the step; secondly, all he had to do was get over your shoulder and trap you. When Melo was at his peak, he was a tough finisher at the basket: because his two-foot jump after breaking through was so explosive, the ground shook when his whole body hit you. Melo has a very amazing advantage. In the 21st century, probably only Kobe is similar: other players take a tentative step and then pull up to shoot. They often need to close their legs and lower their waists to accumulate strength. However, Melo and Kobe can dance on the spot with the ball and take a tentative step. Suddenly they become strong and high. Take action, let me go. During the test step, Melon's center of gravity dropped very deep; when turning his back, Melon's legs split wide. So if you don't bend down to block him, he can do a big split, block a step, break through smoothly when facing the basket, turn around to break through the baseline when turning back, and then jump for a layup. If you also do a big split, he will turn over and throw you directly. He has a low center of gravity, a long stride, a wide body, the ability to break through with both hands, and is a threat to take off quickly and hit mid-range shots at any time and anywhere, and is a threat to shoot at fixed points (so he plays more efficiently in FIBA games than in NBA games). It's really hard to guard against. When Batum first entered the NBA, McMillan taught him defense. To LeBron: ""Prevent him from breaking through."" To Durant: ""Prevent him from shooting."" To Kobe: ""Good luck..."" Kobe is a serial killer with such comprehensive offensive methods, but Pierce is compared to the older ones - —Kobe, Carter, LeBron, Tracy McGrady and Carmelo—it is said that Carmelo is the hardest to guard against. ""He is a unique combination of being tall, strong, running and jumping, and has world-class shooting ability. He can naturally attack the basket - every technical aspect of his game is excellent; some players are good at one or two moves, but Carmelo can do it all. , and he has no specific sweet spot, he can shoot anywhere; his combination of physique and shooting touch is unparalleled, you can't relax for a moment. Kobe is the best scorer in history, but I didn't know when I guarded him from behind. It’s so hard to guard Melo; LeBron is tough, but sometimes you can guard his jump shot; against Carmelo, there is no way.” But... I have said it many times before: In 2003, Alexander Wolfe’s report pointed out that Snow Melo, a freshman at City University: ""Obviously beating the opponent with his back has a higher shooting percentage, but he casually takes a jump shot from time to time."" With such a tough body, Melo has a career shooting percentage of 44.5% and a true shooting percentage of 54.3%. The true shooting percentage in the playoffs is 51%. Because he is such a cool triple threat and has such a strong physique, but he doesn't always go to the basket. His skills are impeccable and graceful, and he also has a body that is so strong that it gives opponents a headache; but when he is about to fight for his life, he will always choose to sway away and make a light jump shot. He doesn't want to be like KG, who didn't pass the first round until the eighth year of his career - but in fact, he has only passed the first round twice in his career. During his playoff career, which was mostly in the first round, Melo shot 41% from the field. Tracy McGrady has always been in the first round in his life, and he has played very well: his career playoff shooting percentage is 43%. We all know that Melo has participated in four Olympic Games and won three championships. He performed brilliantly in the 2012 Olympic Games, but this is something that no one mentions. His three-point rate in the Olympics was 41%, and he hit a total of 139 shots, ranking eleventh in Olympic history. His total Olympic shooting percentage: 43%. Let's make a comparison that may scare people... Melo averaged 11 points per game in four Olympics, shooting 43% from the field and 41% from three-point range. Hu Weidong averaged 11 points per game in three Olympic Games, shooting 45% from the field and 39% from three-point range. No matter how much I am a fan of Hu Weidong, I dare not say that Hu Weidong is better than Melon. Anyone who has seen him play will understand how Melo managed to shoot 43% from the field despite the overwhelming advantage of the US team. In addition to the scoring performance, there is another problem: remove the isolation score, LeBron is still a genius organizer in his peak period, and he is still the defensive ace of Miami; remove the isolation score, the Thunder version of Durant is a runner without the ball. King of the circle, the Warriors version of Durant is an excellent rim protector. . As for Melo's strengths, besides scoring, the only remaining thing he has is... a passable rebounder? When George Karl got Gallinari, he said he planned to let the Italian try out Melo's methods, which were: ""Participate in pick-and-rolls; attack in position; play with the ball."" This is what melons are for. In fact, the Nuggets' record-breaking trip to the Western Conference Finals in the 2008-09 season was also Melo's most glorious season. He averaged 27 points per game in the playoffs that year and 31 points the next year. The reason is simple: Chauncey Billups was in charge. The Nuggets in those two years played entirely around Melo: Melo kept holding the ball in the left and right midfielders in singles, accompanied by Martin and Nene's weak-side connections, Billups and Afflalo's long shots, and J.R. Smith's pursuit. Three-pointers... When Melo is used as a ""ball-handling scoring point"" and he is paired with a ball-handler, shooter, inside lineman, and defender, everything falls into place. You can't just give Melo a ball and let him dribble across half court like you do with LeBron or Wade. ""You can either burst, pass, or shoot, but come up with something!"" You have to let Melo position and arrange it. When others block and cut, you have to give him the ball; he can always score you, but it may not be efficient. Of course, Melo is very good at hitting key goals. He has a big heart and is not nervous. In the 2005-06 season, he led the league in kills. But his murderous intent does not come from Jordan or Bird-style paranoia, but from relaxation - he is very similar to Carter in this regard. He was rarely nervous and always had a smile on his face. On the occasion of the decisive blow, other people would be sweating profusely and wishing they could shrink into their stomachs, but he fell calmly and happily. Except for the 2009 playoffs, he rarely showed the murderous spirit of ""I will never allow the team to lose."" Shot selection has been a persistent issue for him. Accompanying his shot selection is his intermittent defensive enthusiasm. When the game is on the line, true superstars can also show enthusiasm on the defensive end. Run, jump, roll, crawl, and put on a murderous face. And Melo's ""Come on, come on, I will risk my life to win this"" at the critical moment, it is much less; it is more ""I just can make the shot, I am not nervous at all, what's wrong?"" Melo The most important thing is whether you have fun playing ball. If you arrange tactics for him and give him a suitable role, he will play happily; if he is in an unsuitable system, he will be unhappy. By looking at his body language while playing, you can tell whether he is happy or not, and whether he is happy or not directly affects his state. He rarely defends with all his life, and he won't have the motivation to ""if I lose this game, I will fucking kill all my teammates."" After Billups arrived with the Nuggets in 2008, the Denver Post also mentioned that Melo and J.R. Smith imitated Chauncey in dressing and thought Chauncey was cool - and in turn, Melo kept smiling like a little boy. . He's such a skilled scorer that as long as you give him freedom, he's happy. As long as he is happy, he is a good teammate: willing to pass the ball, willing to run actively, and willing to challenge at critical moments. But the premise is: you must first place him in a role he likes and make him happy. Technically, Melo is one of the most precocious players in NBA history. He mastered all the offensive skills that many players spend their entire lives perfecting during his freshman year. Emotionally, he is more of a boy who plays according to his mood, needs accurate positioning, needs someone to help defend, and someone to give the ball in time in order to play well. He can really score - but only for you. Chauncey said something about Melo in the Nuggets, saying that he was a good teammate, but ""he cared too much about scoring 30 points per game."" ""If he scores 20 or 22 points in a game and we win, he will be unhappy; if we lose a game and he scores 36 points, he will be happy."" Maybe for Melo. In other words, the 2003 National College Championship came too easily and too early. His technique was too precocious. What others pursue with difficulty, he obtains with ease. So he felt, ""I don't want to be like KG and it took him eight years to get past the first round."" Magic and Jordan both went through this stage. They both won championships in college, so as soon as they entered the NBA, they thought, ""Shouldn't we aim to win the championship?"" Magic was lucky enough to have a skyhook, but it wasn't until 1987 that he really He took over the Lakers; Jordan struggled to win the championship until seventh grade. According to Chauncey, Melo has not entered the mentality of playing with the bench for a long time, maybe not being able to finish the game, and just wanting to help the team. In hindsight, by the time he got to that mindset—the last three years of his career—it was a little late. And time never stops. In an era where efficiency is paramount, role players no longer need to make emergency mid-range shots. His mid-range shooting with no blind spots has been discounted in value. In an era where defense is paramount, there is no need for a non-center to charge for offensive rebounds. His offensive rebounding sense has been discounted in value. In this era where everyone is in a hurry, unless you can pass an open three-pointer to your teammates, there is no need for you to move back and forth. Melo has to hold the ball within 20 feet to continue scoring. His triple threat has been discounted in value. He has been an outstanding hedge knight for most of his life, with all the advantages and disadvantages of a hedge knight; but the times have quietly advanced to the era of line shooting, and the shortcomings have suddenly become clear. When a person is popular, everything is beautiful. But in the past, it was brutal, simple and direct. The scoring champions of the 1980s were suddenly given up suddenly. Dantley was still playing in the Finals with the Pistons the year before, but was given up by the Assassins and sent to Dallas the next season. Bernard King was 34 years old and still averaged 28 points per game. He was just shy of 20,000 points next season and was given up. Melo has been given up too late - he will be 39 years old in another week. In the last few years of his career, he changed his mentality. In the Trail Blazers and Lakers, in the last three seasons of his career, he actually played hard. He also defended and accepted the role of a spot-up shooter, but he was no longer young by then. If you had the mentality at that time and possessed the 2005-10 Melo, maybe the Nuggets would have a different look? have no idea. If you need to condense the history of Melo's career, it would probably be a jump shot after splitting the three threats. That is his signature skill, a move that has been carried out throughout his NBA career, the basis for his ninth score in history, and the key to his career. He has perfect singles scoring skills, no shooting dead spots, and no flaws to pick. He has a long career and single-quarter explosions in history. He is the kaleidoscope of ultimate scoring. His skills are too precocious, allowing him to play willfully with a smile. For most of his career; if the NBA did not rely on defensive fighting spirit, but a performance of scoring skills, he would be almost unparalleled; he can really score, and few people in the history of basketball can score better than him. ""But from time to time he casually takes a jump shot.""",,,,Anthony announces retirement,433,292,2766,5/23/23 5:23,Weibo web version,"['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1he7v215hamj30i50c3gm3.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1he7v21zbtdg307d07hqv6.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 005ztwqOgy1he7v23j69ng30du0dhe85.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1he7v266cbcg30fv08bb2h.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1he7v26mu81j30i y0p078h.jpg']",,

4.90E+15,N1Mv6AuaH,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"Heat 3-0 Celtic. President Xiao Hua: The Celtics were supposed to face the Lakers, but now the Heat are going to face the Nuggets? Coach Mazzula actually changed his formation today and returned to the regular season small-ball starting lineup. But the problem is still not solved: Tatum is flanked, Jaylen attacks with the ball a lot, White still plays 3D, and so on. When Uduka was on duty last season, let alone his troubles off the court, just talk about it on the court: The Celtics' offense is not smooth, but their defense is iron-clad. In the regular season, the defense was tied with the Warriors for first place. In the playoffs, They defeated the Bucks in seven games and advanced to the Finals; even if they lost to the Warriors in the Finals, the offense was dumb, not the team offense lost to the Warriors - the Warriors' offensive efficiency in the regular season last season was 113, and they beat the Nuggets by 123. The Bears scored 110, beat Dallas 124, and the offensive efficiency in the finals was 111, and it was only won by Curry using his unique skills. Coach Mazzula leads the team with a small formation, movement without the ball, and free play. Redick said in the spring that when the offense is good, it will be smooth, and when it is bad, it will be sluggish. The two heroes can only make single passes, so there is a wave of flow. Leave once and never come back. The coach didn't even call a timeout. Speaking of this contrast from the roaring Iron Army to the laissez-faire... At the beginning of this century, Larry Brown led the Detroit Pistons to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2003, became famous as the grassroots championship in 2004, and played seven games with the Spurs in 2005. At that time, the Pistons were famous for being brutal and monotonous, and a ratings killer. Grandpa Brown stepped down and Coach Sanders came up. He was used to watching everyone in the Timberwolves - mainly led by KG - play freely, allowing the Pistons to play more smoothly. In the 2005-06 season, the Pistons won a record 64 games. good. The Eastern Conference finals were defeated by the Miami Heat: Wade shot 62% and the Sharks shot 66%. The next year, the Pistons led the Cavaliers 2-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals, and then were defeated by the Cavaliers in four consecutive games, including LeBron's 48 points in Game 5 and 25 points in a row, including a shot from Gibson in Game 6. ——Brother Brown’s temperament, before he was shot 60% by Wade and the Sharks, and LeBron scored 25 consecutive points to come back, he had already scolded the entire team until they had a cerebral hemorrhage. ——Coach Sanders just looked at the general trend and ran away. If Tiejun is allowed to let go, it is easy for him to release himself and play well, but if the coach does not control it steadily, it is easy for him to lose. The reason for mentioning this is: Udoka is from the Spurs, and Popovich is a disciple of Grandpa Brown. Last season, the Celtics were repeatedly shut down by Udoka. Duncan, Parker and Ginobili also experienced it under Pop. Brown was even more in charge of everything, turning the Pistons into a blue-collar beast camp. By the way, if the AI is managed as a No. 2 player without the ball, it seems like a miracle now. As for Coach Majora, according to Gerwei and Smart, he doesn't call timeouts, and sometimes he doesn't say a word when he does. ——Coaches who act cool without saying a word include: Zen Master. But what kind of prestige and control does a Zen master have? He also knew that he had Jordan and Kobe under his command, so he didn’t need to yell, just look at each other. ——Like Riley, he is getting older. In the 2006 Finals, should he yell or yell, should he smash the blackboard or smash it? He stopped players at the airport and did not allow them to take more luggage to Dallas. ""We will finish in six games! No one is allowed to take the first place."" Baggage for seven games!"" Coach Mazzula started with a small ball in the starting lineup today, and that's it. Look at coach Spoelstra's response: At the beginning, the Heat immediately asked Love to find a back-up switch to hit Smart, another three-pointer from the corner, and an Adebayor layup to make it 7-3. ""You play small ball, right? Do you think we don't have an inside line? Do you think we are not prepared?"" Then Love was injured and the rotation was disrupted. Coach Spoelstra replaced Martin and the game was over. Caleb Martin, who will be 28 in the fall, is an undrafted player. He was almost 24 years old when he entered the NBA. During the draft, he was considered to be able to shoot but not a high jumper, not very smooth but easily forced into crowds, big-hearted but prone to random shooting, not compact in dribbling, prone to fouls... He is said to be a swingman but in fact he is. The height of the 2nd position and the speed of the 3rd position. 25 points in the last game at Boston Garden. After playing for Loew today, he scored 18 points - 8 points in the first quarter. As I said after the last game, Coach Spoelstra’s purpose is to cherish the strengths of role players and cover up their weaknesses. Martin can shoot open baskets, but is he not reliable when dribbling into a crowd? Then feed him the ball specifically: In the last game against the Celtics, Jimmy and Adebayor took turns setting screens for Martin to force a switch; today Jimmy had 6 assists, two of which were for Martin's open three-pointers, and one for Being flanked, Martin cut in for a layup. Lowry fed him pick-and-roll three-pointers, and Vincent fed him breakthrough three-pointers. The funniest thing is: there was even a three-pointer, which was fed to Martin by Duncan Robinson. When the Heat reached the Finals three years ago, Dunro was a second-year shooter. He became a substitute in the playoffs last season, and he remains the same this season. But in the playoffs, it was used again. In the last game at the Boston Garden, Dunro scored 15 points. He pretended to cut inside and stole points under the basket. Coach Spoelstra saw that he had a goal, so he simply asked Dunro to hold the ball today: break through Brogdon, steal the back door, and score suddenly. Martin scored a three-pointer - Dunro's career-high 4 assists in the playoffs today. It's much better than Porter's 6 assists yesterday. Both Martin and Dunro were utilized, so it’s not difficult to understand Vincent’s 29 points today: Horford couldn’t be guarded when shooting with the ball, and the rotation of White and Smart – these two were very effective in handling the ball and switching defenses. It’s okay, but it’s small after all. If you look carefully at Vincent's 29 points today, and then look at Curry's performance against Smart and Horford in last year's finals, you will naturally understand: Oh, it comes from here... It's so exciting, where are Jimmy and Adebayor? Jimmy scored a playoff-low 16 points today, third on the team. Adebayor made the fewest 5 shots in the playoffs today - he shot 5 baskets in 25 minutes, and Love shot 3 baskets in less than 5 minutes. One of them is hot blood and soul, the other is hot glue, but they are too lazy to attack at all. They are busy with other things: Jimmy has 6 assists - 5 of them are three-pointers, and one of them is Martin's inside layup. ; Adebayor did a very cunning job, which cannot be reflected in the data: in the first quarter, he frequently blocked the screen and even committed an offensive foul. ——This is what Tucker was responsible for back then: use this move to test the referee's standards and bottom line today, ""As long as the referee doesn't call, I will keep pushing."" This life was under Bogut's control during the Warriors' days. Speaking of which... In the playoffs so far this season, Adebayor has averaged a career-high 19 points per game, not to mention a career-high 5.2 screen assists per game, blocking 13 points for his teammates per game - except Savoy and Jokic, he is the highest. Adebayor: ""Deng Luo, you're welcome!"" Finally, Jimmy Butler attacked less today, but he attacked wisely: his offensive choices made me admire Coach Spoelstra so much. Today, Jimmy only had White, not to mention, after all, he had already beaten the Celtics; the wonderful thing is that of his 6 assists today, three of them were switching defenses to force Lowe to deal with him. When Lowe is healthy, he is the top defender in the league, but Jimmy picked him by name? ——Lowe is excellent in internal combat and defensive forward switching, but his most suitable role is to be a flanker and weak-side replacement similar to JJJ. ——Jimmy moved him to the upper line to take charge of single defense. The Celtics had to have someone rotate under the basket to make up for Lowe's vacancy. However, Lowe was not so comfortable at the three-point line against defenders. ——So the Celtics were left open on the outside, and Jimmy fed three three-pointers. Today, he beat Lowe many times, but only once was he actually challenged Lowe, which was to take Lowe away. Naturally, he knew that the Celtics would miss out on the outside. Both are masters of floor flow and have evolved into stars in 3D, but this is the difference between Jimmy and Leonard: instigation. Leonard has averaged 5 assists per game four times in his career, and Jimmy has averaged eight. Leonard averaged 6 assists per game in a single series, and in the 2020 Finals, Jimmy provided 59 assists in six games. So: Coach Spoelstra combines Vincent’s ball-handling and basket, Martin’s spot-up basket, Dunro’s off-ball movement, Adebayo’s screen, Jimmy’s ball-handling ability, Strus’ diligence, and Los Angeles Rui's instigation came into play, and even Love scored 5 points in the 5 minutes before leaving the court - playing behind the back to switch defenders and shooting a fixed-point three-pointer. At the same time, Lowe was called out to bully alone, and the rotation of Smart and White was used to target Horford's inability to defend and surround the two heroes. When Philadelphia almost eliminated the Celtics, Lao Li made a mistake: Tatum named Maxey to win the sixth game in a row, and Tatum named Embiid to win the seventh game in a row. Coach Spoelstra: Shouldn't we look for the opponent's misplaced points to bully, and not let the opponent bully our own misplaced points? How could such a mistake be made? Oh, Lao Li... If Lao Li leads Philadelphia to eliminate the Celtics, will he do better than Mazzula? have no idea. After all, Philadelphia was also beaten by the Heat last year. In my impression, Lao Li and Spoelstra played four series, and Lao Li lost three sets: 2011, 2012 and last year. The only time Lao Li won against Spoelstra was in 2010. At that time, Lao Li had the Celtics' old three giants and Rondo in their growing years, and Spoelstra had the rebuilding craze on the eve of the ""decision"": the chief scorer next to Wade was the second-year Beasley. Well, this is just a casual piece. I just thought about Lao Li and couldn't help but talk a few more words. Yesterday when the Nuggets beat the Lakers 3-0, they mentioned: In last season’s playoffs, Jokic brought Gordon, Barton, Morris and Lao Li’s son to play against the Warriors, and then came this season’s Murray, Porter, Bruce Brown and KCP. Of the 2020 Nuggets, only Jokic, Murray and Porter are still on the team. Today the Heat 3-0 the Celtics, but in fact the team structure has also changed: three years ago it was Jimmy + Adebayor, Hiero rushed the bench, Dragic distributed the ball, Claude did the dirty work, Deng Luo is still the main shooter. Vincent only played a brief moment that postseason. Now it's still Jimmy + Adebayor, but Vincent, Strus, Love and Martin are up, and Lowry is helping to adjust the bench. Oh, and Haslem. How much hardship did each other go through? Yesterday at the home court in Los Angeles, celebrities gathered on the sidelines; the commentators joked that to Jokic, a fat foreigner like him, they are just a bunch of strangers in fancy clothes. Yesterday, sitting next to President Xiao Hua was the CEO of Disney. As a result, the Nuggets defeated the Lakers 3-0, which was a very uncommercial result. Today the Heat defeated the Celtics 3-0 again, which was also a very uncommercial result. But if we just talk about basketball itself, that is, the coach sets up the formation, the players move, each performs his duties, blocks, passes, shoots, finds openings, finds mismatches, teamwork, diligence, and overcoming sudden adversity (yesterday Jokic’s first He was whistled out in the third quarter, and Love was injured in the opening game today). Yesterday's Nuggets and today's Heat beat 3-0, which are all tributes to basketball itself: it is the most basic, the coach arranges it well, and the players play well. , every puzzle on the bench is used, everyone does their own thing. Coach Spoelstra said after the game that his team is ""stable, mature, and professional."" Pure basketball. Yesterday, Jokic played his worst game in the playoffs this season, and the Nuggets went 3-0. Jimmy played his worst game in the playoffs this season today, with the Heat going 3-0. Three years ago, Jimmy went to the Finals and Jokic went to the Western Conference Finals and lost respectively. Three years later, their respective teams have been plagued by injuries. To this day, they have carried the team through countless ups and downs, and each has built a ""stable, mature, and professional"" team. Their own starlight has actually dimmed a bit: this season Jokic and Jimmy were assigned to the second team of the year in the regular season, and Jimmy simply did not make the All-Star list this season. But the winning contributions so far in the playoffs this season are WS. The top two are: Jokic and Jimmy (digression: the last two are Big Eyebrow and Tatum). WS every 48 minutes, the top two: Jokic, Jimmy (digression: the last two are Booker and Brunson). So for them, who have worked hard and carried the team all the way, this is a wonderful consolation. Jokic & Jimmy: I have been fighting for so long, what’s wrong with enjoying it? #heatvsceltics#",,,,Heat vs Celtics,30,55,411,5/22/23 17:20,Weibo web version,,,

4.91E+15,N4V4D9rHd,7490198551,Just about the Rockets,"[Fagan writes about how the Rockets use $60 million in space during the offseason] For a team like the Rockets with $60 million in salary space, preparing for the free agent market has become the key to determining the best path. A strong point is that the clearest path is also the best if possible. If Harden is what they want, the Rockets can be confident enough to bring Harden back to the Rockets. Understandably, however, given how unusual it is for a veteran player to join a 22-win team - the Rockets will also have to decide if Harden has a role for them and the ongoing rebuild. Pros: Harden led the NBA in assists per game for the second time last season, and he's still an excellent passer. The Rockets can obviously take advantage of this. He can help the growth of Jaylen Green and Smith Jr. and facilitate the off-ball play of Porter Jr., the Rockets' best catch-and-shoot three-point shooter. Although Harden is no longer the league's leading scorer during the Rockets' era, he is still the best scorer among elite assisters. And the Rockets still have enough cap space to add another veteran, and Harden may attract the Rockets to get the kind of 3D player complement they want. Cons: Harden turns 34 this summer. If signed to a three- to four-year contract, he would be entering the latter stages of his career with his contract expiring. By the time the Rockets' young talent is ready for a big win, he might not be. Because people are understandably skeptical of Harden, who has shown signs of decline since leaving Houston. Even in the short term, Harden is far from the kind of defensive player that fits the vision of new coach Uduka. How Harden cooperates with Shen Jing is also a problem. While he can help free up Green offensively, as he did with Maxey in Philadelphia, Harden can also take the ball away from Green and limit the Rockets' leading scorer, whose continued development is critical to the team's overall scheme of things. Crucial. Instead of trying to spend their cap on the most expensive free agents -- Harden, Irving, VanVleet, Middleton, Porzingis, and maybe Paul (if he's still considered a top free agent) ——The Rockets can actually consider chasing three free agents in their 20s because they can grow with young people. There are at least some interesting names worth considering: Cameron Johnson and Austin Reeves are both restricted free agents who would be hard-pressed to bid their teams out, especially Reeves, who might Would expect the Lakers to match any offer. It might also be difficult for Hart to leave New York. Then, Bruce Brown, Vincent and Strus may be more valuable to their championship team than the rebuilding Rockets. There are players at the level of Dillon Brooks, DiVincenzo, Clarkson, Gervais and Oubre who still need to continue to be considered. Another way to quickly solve the cap space problem this year is to trade for the next disgruntled superstar. But it's hard, almost impossible, to predict who will be next. The Rockets can complete any deal without matching salary. They have enough first-round picks and some interesting young talent to lure a team looking to trade for its star. But the Rockets are also certain: If they continue to wait, someone like Jaylen Brown or another star player around the league can be acquired as a free agent. For the team, fixed rotation players who meet value and real needs can theoretically be obtained through free agency without the Rockets having to give up draft picks or players they have worked hard to collect in the past. So stay the course (i.e. trust the process) – just because you have money to spend doesn’t mean spending money is necessary. The Rockets could choose to use their draft picks and continue to give young players enough playing time to develop. #HoustonRockets##nbaTucaoConference#",,,,"Houston Rockets, nba complaints conference",0,6,16,6/12/23 8:40,rocket super talk,['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/008aU6O3gy1hev56acf8bj312w0jcacz.jpg'],,

4.90E+15,N1Ewtj6TN,1808638663,Citizen Uitler,"The Rockets' lineup is like this. The entire forward group is floor-level. With Shen Jing's skills and Smith's shooting, neither of them can fly in the sky...except for Martin, no one else can play a simple pick-and-roll with the two guards. Being able to attack the frame along the way...the starting dynamic talent is actually relatively poor...so I hope the Rockets can add a player in the starting lineup who can fly and play, which is equivalent to giving wings to Porter Green's engine. Then can you tell me not to take this route? Of course it is possible. For example, if you add a shooter, then you are playing a different system, more like one inside and four outside around Shen Jing, but this system is definitely more technical flow, focusing on passing and running, which is tactics. Driven. But playing like this will test every player's ability to handle the ball and read the game. And this is precisely the shortcoming of the Rockets' current personnel. It definitely needs more time to run in and debug. Are the Warriors' dynamic talents strong? Splash is a shooting type, and the two insiders Looney and Green are both skilled. Only Wiggins is all-around, holding the ball, shooting, dynamic, and passing. He has no specialization but is better in all-around. It is precisely because of this in the Warriors. Wiggins' characteristics can be exploited only under the system. They represent the upper limit of technical flow. The existing foundation of the Rockets does not support the Warriors' logic of team building. I know everyone likes 3D, as Rockets fans who watch games with Harden all know. Why the Rockets were so good in 17-18 was because Harden and Paul took care of all the ball-holding work. What they needed from other positions was to make three-pointers and then come back and switch defense. Harden doesn't need the ball-handling ability of a striker, because he himself is the core of the ball. For such a Rocket, 3D is of course the Rockets' favorite. But today is no different than in the past. Although Greenport plays a pick-and-roll game with the ball, he is completely unable to compare with Harden. Shen Jing is also a skilled player, not a high-flying and brainless pie-eating player. Smith is still a pure finishing point. This makes it difficult for the connection between the two guards and the center to be as simple as a pick-and-roll to solve the problem. This is why I care about the forward's ability to handle the ball. Pure 3D is not what the Rockets need most at the moment. In other words, in addition to shooting and defense, you have to have other offensive values. There needs to be a point for transition and connection between the Rockets' guards and center. So my idea of solving the problem is as follows. The optimal solution is to add a physical man to the striker, but he is required to be able to handle the ball, organize and overshoot. If he can also shoot, that would be great. The alternative solution is to add a man to the striker. A pitcher forms one inside and four outside, allowing Shen Jing to control the offense, and the other four points will develop tactics around him. This is my basic policy for looking at the Rockets' reinforcement route, so I will follow these two directions when selecting people. My logic. #HoustonRockets##2023nbadraft#",,,,"Houston rockets, 2023 nba draft",0,42,50,5/21/23 21:01,,,,

Now the problem is getting clearer and clearer! With the arrival of the Pengci Alliance, I feel more and more that Irving is very powerful! Recently, JR Smith, a former teammate of the Cavaliers, praised Irving on the show! He said: ""Irving is the best pure scorer in history. Compared with him, Curry and Jordan are far behind. There is nothing he can't do on the offensive end. He can shoot with both hands, and he has mid-range. He can shoot threes, he can spot up, he can shoot off the dribble. He has the best ballhandling we've ever seen, he's the best finisher at the rim, he can turn with both hands, he's a great free throw shooter, He can be in the 180 club. The only reason why he is not in the 180 club is that he only shoots difficult shots. Creatively speaking, no one is better than him. Whether it is 4 people guarding him or 5 people guarding him, it will still matter. It doesn't matter. The host asked again: ""Where is Curry?"" Smith replied: ""No, it's still far from it. Curry is the best shooter in history, but in terms of pure scoring, no one in history is better than Irving."" The host asked again: ""Jordan?"" Smith replied: ""It's still far away."" Although Smith was a bit exaggerated, it can be seen that Irving is definitely very strong in the eyes of most coaches, players, and general managers. The presence! In this business league, today's players have no skills at all, they all rely on the rules! And Irving is the only player in the league who doesn't commit fouls and really relies on his own skills to put the ball into the basket. His free throws are pitiful! His style of play is unique in the entire NBA history, and his skills will always be number one in history in my eyes. This is something that many players, general managers, and coaches have unanimously acknowledged! O'Neal once said that Irving is the only player in the league who can score pure points. He does not commit fouls or throw away three-pointers. He has unique finishing ability. He likes singles very much and does not like covering. His style of play is very entertaining! Why does Owen have no honors, but he has a high reputation? Because he has skills, appreciation, and strength! This is the unique European fairy!

4.90E+15,N1DlcjRXy,5127411737,Stupid talk,"Recently, I have been very interested in the contrast between Murray and Russell in the playoffs and the Heat's extraordinary playoff performance, so I tried to make a simple table to explore the career free throw performance and free throw performance of more than 40 guards who met the filtering conditions. The relationship between offensive performance in the postseason. The filtering conditions are as follows: 1. Playing time in the playoffs is more than 700 minutes. 2. The playoff round share is above 15%. 3. Take at least 4 three-pointers every 36 minutes in the playoffs. 4. Entered the All-Star Game 2 times at most. Of course, it is purely for entertainment, and this does not lead to many valuable conclusions, but I think some things are worthy of attention: 1. Murray is an extremely accurate free throw shooter. 2. Both are white shooters. Huerter and Harris seem to have a huge gap in free throw skills with Curry Jr. and Duncan Robinson. The first two are even guards with free throw deviations in the NBA. 3. In the same way, Russell is also a defender with free throw deviation. 4. Personally, I think among the top players in free throw shooting, Herro and Brogdon's performance surprised me. I am willing to believe that they can perform better after playing more playoff games. 5. I originally wanted to add some filtering conditions or data, but finally gave up. Some people here have higher obpm in the playoffs, but that may be because of other contributions such as passing control (such as Holiday), and there are also short guards who have neither talent nor mid-range skills who can't play well in the playoffs. Understandably (such as VanVleet), there are also some players who prefer 3D engineers (such as Matthews). 6.

4.90E+15,N1wv7btWo,1808638663,Citizen Uitler,"Imagine a scene, starting at 1:15 of the video, the Thunder's counterattack. The defender advanced with the ball and passed it to the advancing Gidi. This is a pretty typical counterattack. If this scene is changed to the Rockets, during the counterattack, Porter advances with the ball and passes it to Smith/Ethan/Martin on the striker, then what will happen next? There is a high probability that these three people will attack head-first and complete the attack with one finish. But whether they can finish has always been a problem, because apart from Martin, Ethan's finishing skills at the basket and Smith's explosive power have always been a headache for the Rockets. And this happens to be one of the reasons for the low efficiency of the Rockets' counterattack - the forward lacks the ability to handle the ball for a second time, and his finishing skills (ability) are not enough. And what did Giddy do in the video? After receiving the ball, he quickly moves to the corner shooter in a wide range. What the Rockets lack most now is a skill that allows him to transition between the defender and the forward. If Smith is running past the corner, and Porter advances with the ball, when he passes forward, Who is the person who responded in the middle? If it is Green, of course he can break through directly, but there are already two people under the opponent's basket to help defend, which requires him to have the awareness to quickly read and release the ball, or he can ignore the multi-person defense under the basket and finish violently. And last season. He fell short on both options. So in other words. The Rockets need to supplement the position between the defender and the forward. They need to have a strong overall view or a strong impact ability. It is best to have both. Amen Thompson is the perfect one. Isn't this exactly the solution to this problem? Not only can he get to the basket directly with his taller body, but he also has good court vision and ball-distribution skills to quickly move in a wide range? It seems that no other rookie within the Rockets' reach can do both of these things, right? This is the advantage of Amen. I personally recommend this scenario substitution method. You can imagine a certain scenario from other teams, substitute the Rockets' configuration, and analyze the team's needs to determine who is suitable for the Rockets and who is not. Whether this method is right or not is a matter of opinion. Just a way of thinking. #HoustonRockets##2023nbadraft#『O web link』O web link",,,,"Houston rockets, 2023 nba draft",2,24,35,5/21/23 0:36,,,,

Vincent, Martin, and Strus were not high-quality shooters in the regular season this year, but they dared to take action in the playoffs. After catching the ball, he is very decisive whether he throws a sudden pass or not, and is never sloppy. They force defensive players to make split-second decisions, making it easier for them to sway people out of formation. Tucker (whose three-point shooting percentage was even higher in the regular season) was in an open position after receiving the ball and did not dare to shoot, did not dare to break out, and could not pass the ball, so the defender easily returned to his position.

4.90E+15,N1sLEiilq,5533010788,Love Spurs,"[2023 # Spurs Draft # Observation] Highlights of Turkey/UCLA black and tough inside man Adem Bona’s exciting games Adem Bona (AdemBona) Team: UCLA Position: Center Height: 208 Wingspan: 224 Age: 20.2 Weight: 107kg Quote: Averaged 22.9 minutes per game after the second round, scoring 7.7 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks. The shooting percentage was 67.5%, the three-point shooting percentage was 0%, and the free throw percentage was 57.3%. Player introduction (from website: NBADRAFT) Adem Bona (Adem Bona) was first known to Chinese fans as Turkish Antetokounmpo. He comes from Nigeria. He was naturalized by Turkey in 2018 and began to focus on training. Because he was born before the age of 16 Having obtained a Turkish passport, he can be used as a local player. He received professional basketball training for a short period of time and his skills are rough, but his physical fitness is quite strong. In 2003, there was almost no second opponent in Europe who could match his physical condition. Bona practiced football when he was a child. Like many NBA players of African origin, he eventually switched from football to basketball due to height issues. One of his basketball videos successfully attracted the attention of Turkish basketball coach Türkay Çakıroğlu. Before coming to Turkey to attend Prolific Preparatory School, he played for the local Turkish team Pinar Karsiyaka for one season. However, because he was only 16 years old at the time, he Didn't get many opportunities. In the 2019 U16 European Youth Championship, he averaged 14.1 points, 10.3 rebounds and 4 blocks per game for Turkey, helping the Turkish team finally rank fifth. He himself also ranked second in the rebounding and blocking charts with his outstanding performance, and was shortlisted. The best lineup of the tournament. The SI scouting report stated that Bona is a raw but physically strong big man. His draft prospects are difficult to determine. He may easily shine at UCLA and rush into the first round of the player. It may also require more than one player. It takes a season of training to reach the level of an NBA player. Offensively, Bona takes most of his shots in the paint and, in fact, dunks on just about any ball he can get his hands on, using his strength to overpower defenders and get shots around the rim. He has big hands, making him efficient when catching the ball in the box. With that in mind, the 6-foot-10 center also has excellent footwork and reliable dribbling moves. He has an effective spin move that he likes to use in the paint and is overall very quick for his size. Although Bona is not a three-point shooter yet, his mid-range jumper is still trustworthy. It's certainly not his strong point offensively, but he's improved in that area. While his free throw percentage isn't great, you can see the potential for him to eventually develop into a perimeter shooter. Defensively, Bona is an excellent shot blocker and all-around rim protector. He has a good combination of length and length, which allows him to change up his shot on a regular basis. He's also great in pick-and-roll defense given how much ground he can cover. Looking at his current position, the UCLA freshman does sometimes rely too much on his athletic ability. And he's prone to fouling. #San Antonio Spurs##超话综合官#LLove Spurs’ Weibo video",,,,"Spurs draft, San Antonio Spurs, super talk creative officer",4,22,70,5/20/23 15:06,NBA Super Talk,,"http://f.video.weibocdn.com/o0/VvOc33Dmlx085yZCsQ3C01041204LosR0E020.mp4?label=mp4_720p&template=1280x720.25.0&ori=0&ps=1BVp4ysnknHVZu&Expires=1694323500&ssig=% 2FbioNscYyL&KID=unistore,video",

Averaged 31.7 minutes per game and scored 14.2 points. 2.8 rebounds, 2.0 assists, shooting 41.4% from the field, 36.8% from the three-point range, and 80.0% from the free throw line. 1.

Under the basket, but the first step is not fast enough, and there is no change when facing tight perimeter defense or crouching defense. He can only be forced to stop the ball or end up with a strike. His explosive power is not very good, and he cannot get rid of the defense one-on-one with the ball. In terms of human ability, he often relies on people to break through. He has a certain awareness of air cuts and can use counter-running and other methods to get out of position. However, compared to the basket, he is still more confident on the outside than on the basket. 2. As a 3D player, he has acceptable vision and some ability to handle the ball. He has a certain ability to play pick-and-roll. He can cooperate with the big center in passing and cutting after the pick-and-roll. When he is without the ball, he can attack from the weak side. After running to the strong side to catch the ball, you can observe the position of your teammates and quickly release the ball, break points or cooperate with high and low positions. The ball delivery speed and passing awareness are pretty good. 3. The choice of shots is sometimes unreasonable.

There are often situations where I forcefully pull against others, and sometimes there are There are situations where he takes a hasty shot without adjusting his steps after catching the ball, but overall, he is still a trustworthy shooter. 4. The foot movement speed is good, and the lateral movement can cope with some ordinary number one positions, but the defensive pressure is not enough. He does not like to put too much pressure on the ball carrier to force the opponent to play the ball or cause the opponent to make mistakes, squeeze the screen and go around the screen. The small details need to be paid attention to, and the defensive concentration also needs to be improved. Sometimes he gets distracted and is not a ""junk dog"" who is willing to bite his opponents hard on the defensive end. 5. Dribbling is relatively loose, and he is prone to dropping the ball when faced with high-intensity defenses. His physical talent is average, his ability to score continuously is insufficient, and his upper limit is not high. He is unlikely to develop a strong ball-handling offense, but he still has a chance to become a player in the NBA.

4.90E+15,N12RoqLHo,1294977681,Durant,"Let’s continue to briefly talk about the analysis of tomorrow’s NBA game: Celtics VS Heat. Before we talk about tonight’s Nuggets VS Lakers, if the Lakers want to win this game, it is impossible to be behind by 18 points at halftime, but this The Nuggets are also an old drama. After Aaron Gordon made one of two free throws at 5 minutes and 11 seconds of the fourth quarter, the Nuggets fell into a scoring drought and sent the Lakers eight free throws in a row. They did not score a single point in the sports game. What the hell are you playing? You were purely cooperating with the organization to perform and kill the Nuggets. In the end, Jokic only won by 6 points by making one of two free throws. This was purely a game played by Pan Go. , the Nuggets wanted to break through, but already had a wave of losses in the fourth quarter. The Lakers wanted to win, and they wouldn't be that far behind in the first half. OK, let’s get back to the subject. It has been 113 days since the last regular season meeting between the two sides and the first game of the Eastern Conference Finals. An NBA season is like a reincarnation. Both teams have nearly four months to adjust, hone and improve. However, their understanding of each other has gone far beyond what the schedule can accommodate, because this is the third time the two teams have met in the Eastern Conference Finals in the past four years, and in recent years, the basics of the two teams have... In fact, there are no big changes. The Celtics have been regarded as the favorite team to break out of the Eastern Conference for most of this year's playoffs. On the other hand, the Heat are completely a dark horse. They have become the second team in league history to reach the playoffs. Eighth seed in the conference finals (the first team to do this was the 1999 Knicks). ""Getting to the Eastern Conference Finals is a really difficult task,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We have set goals of varying degrees of difficulty for ourselves this season, but when you really do it When you get to this point (reaching the Eastern Conference Finals), you will definitely be very grateful for the opportunity, because this is what a lot of teams dream of."" Now there are only the last two teams left in the East, and between these two teams Among them, only one can become the king of the Eastern Conference this season in the series that starts on Thursday. The organization gave a score of 211.5 for this game. I don’t think it looks like a big score. The two teams actually went to battle. A score of 230+ can be achieved, but I don’t think the Heat will compete with the Celtics. Go play against each other, because you will definitely not be able to beat the Celtics if you play at a fast pace. In the first round of the Heat's game against the Bucks, it was because Antetokounmpo pretended to be B and didn't play for a few games. In the end, he couldn't beat them and lost. This round, the Heat are playing the Knicks. Barrett, the eternal ice shooter, and Randall, the ball tyrant of the youth team. It is normal for such a team to be unable to beat the Heat. But Kaizi's striker is really strong. I can only say that in this game, I still rely on my feelings to handicap the Celtics.

4.90E+15,N0S0UsPPU,1808638663,Citizen Uitler,"Regarding the significance of joint trials and the team's priorities, Wasserman's tweet today made it very clear. He puts interviews, competitions and social networking in the top three. The specific measured values came later. Just like Bunyama, Bencairo last year, and CC Green the year before that, even if they don't participate in the body side, it will not affect their final result of entering the league with a high pick. During the COVID-19 pandemic two years ago, I read an article that introduced that the significance of the joint trial training was actually a platform event organized to help scouts, general managers of each team, and agents come together to exchange information with each other. Because before this format existed in the past, agents and managers had to fly around to observe and communicate with players, which was a waste of time and money. In order to save everyone’s time, the league organized this format to put all aspects of heads together. Brains come together to improve efficiency. Really talented and high-ranking newcomers do not need joint trials to demonstrate their advantages. It is often those players who are underestimated and whose expected draft picks are not satisfactory, who will take advantage of this exposure opportunity and work hard to strive for a higher expected draft pick. The most obvious example is Jay Wei of the Thunder last year. Because he was in the minor leagues, he was not taken seriously. The school is located in a relatively remote area. Going to his place for an inspection was a long and tiring journey, so that relatively few people knew him before the joint trial. But Jiewei seized the opportunity and performed well in the combine trials, successfully improving his selection to the lottery. There were other outstanding performers in last year's trial training, such as the Spurs' second-round pick Wisecamp, who also performed well in dynamic touch and confrontation matches. He is a very good white forward shooter and was successfully selected by the Spurs in the second round. But success in the trial does not mean that he will definitely stand out in the competition on the professional path. Wisecamp has been underperforming in the Spurs and the Development League, and was eventually waived (and later picked up by the Raptors). The former Durant In the bench press test of the joint trial (this test is no longer available), he only lifted one... but it did not affect his being selected second and later becoming a superstar in the league; in turn, Takfar also He once set records for height, wingspan and reach during trial training. However, Fall only plays for the Xinjiang team now... So the greater significance of the joint trial lies in the relationship between the agency team, team management and the players themselves. After all, it is not easy to meet him once, but these things will not be reported, and it is difficult for outsiders to understand how the communication between them went. These are all huge information asymmetries. But it is an indispensable and important part of the modern draft. These are things fans will never know. Not to mention us who are thousands of miles away. So the draft thing is mainly based on guesswork... #2023nbadraft# By the way, Mike Schmitz, a former ESPN draft expert and one of the founders of DraftExpress, has been tweeting about his interviews with rookies in the past two years. video. In addition to normal Q&A, some rounds of college games will also be selected, and players will be asked to analyze what they did well and what they did poorly. These are all part of interviews with players and teams. If you are interested, you can find it yourself on Twitter. However, with Schmitz signing with the Trail Blazers, no one seems to be doing this kind of thing anymore...

4.91E+15,N3OZU2keB,6212444187,Basketball burning zone,"Recently, the US media revealed Curry’s three-point record in the Finals so far. His number of three-pointers in the finals was as high as 152, ranking first in history, and he even set a record of 32 three-pointers in a single round of the finals series. He also created 9 three-pointers in a single game in the Finals, and in one game, he increased the number of three-pointers to 6. It is not difficult to see that Curry's three-point firepower is both amazing and outstanding, which has become a cultural phenomenon. His shooting technique has been imitated by many basketball enthusiasts and professional players. In addition, even though Curry played one less series in this year's playoffs, he still ranked first in the league in three-pointers made in this year's playoffs, and his total points in the fourth quarter also ranked first in the league. This shows that his shooter nature has been profoundly improved at critical moments in the game, which is also where he is best at three-pointers. He can quickly break through the defense from Wanjun, greatly increasing the offensive threat and tearing apart the opponent's defense. In the game, Curry's influence can be said to be everywhere. He plays very actively and constantly improves his skills and skills, which is why he became a great shooter. #nbaTucaoConference##nba#",,,,"NBA Tucao Conference, nba",0,0,0,6/5/23 3:22,NBA Super Talk,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hemsmrhrp7j30u011haes.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/006MqMwHgy1hemsmri2t9j30u011htdu.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/ 006MqMwHgy1hemsmrfvh9j30u00z5di5.jpg']",,

4.90E+15,N0KxBEIqf,7641503909,Celtssssss,"series of ups and downs, the game situation is like this, and my mood is also like this. Let’s do a simple review first. The Celtics team's sense of crisis and energy on the field in G1 was almost zero. This may be due to Embiid's truce, missing rebounds and missing shooters. Although Tatum had the second-best shooting performance in this series. , the role players also performed well, but Harden was obviously the hero of this game, and it was no surprise that he made the final shot. I have seen too many games like this. But in the end, the mistakes made by Brogdon and Smart were really disappointing, and Jaylen's number of shots in the second half was also a bit baffling. G2 Tatum's state was very sluggish, but it did not affect the team's three-point offensive touch and he won it easily. Embiid's state was improved, and Harden also returned to a familiar feeling. The whole team was in very good shape in G3. The 76ers were chasing points like crazy at the last minute. Tatum beat Harris three times and scored 7 points in a row, which was still crucial. G4 was played in the early morning. I watched the fourth quarter around 5:30. Looking at the data, Tatum was in a very sluggish state in the first half. He began to recover in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter and overtime, Tatum and the team’s playing temperament was really good. It's very good, especially Tatum's playing temperament, defensive effort and offensive performance. There are no problems. In the end, he lost to rebounds and Harden's quasi-kill. Smart's two buzzer-beating opportunities were a bit Pity. This is the most acceptable loss for fans this year. G5 was beaten by the 76ers throughout the game. It looked very desperate. Maxi was also in excellent condition. In fact, the Celtics did not make any strategic or tactical mistakes in this game. They were just inaccurate in the game where accuracy was most needed. . Tatum was extremely sluggish in the first half, but regained some form in the second half, as if he was the only one in the team who knew how to play. The whole scene was really despairing. Neither Tatum nor Brown showed up when it was time for them to stand up. After watching it, I posted that desperate message on WeChat Moments. Although I had feelings for Kai at the time, There was a glimmer of hope, but basically I was still in despair and felt like there was no chance. In the first half of G6, the team had a good three-point touch except for Tatum, and the content of the game shown by Tatum was also very, very, very disappointing. This was not only a matter of not being able to score. In the third quarter, the 76ers began to chase points frantically, but Kai's three-point touch was declining. Tatum's game state was even worse. It was the kind of sluggish and collapsed game state that made fans desperate in G6 of last year's finals. , only relying on Jaylen and Brogdon, Brother Gang struggled to support. In the first half of the fourth quarter, the situation remained unchanged. The 76ers were getting better and better. At this time, I was completely... watching the game with a smile on my face, because... it was so familiar and I had expected it. At this time, with the benefit of hindsight, the moment came that changed Tatum's entire career, the entire Celtics team, and even the NBA landscape. Tatum scored four consecutive three-pointers and four free throws in the final quarter, scoring 16 points in a row to surpass the 76ers. It can be said that he saved the Celtics' season and his own career. In addition, Brother Gang’s game is really crucial. G7 was an early morning game again. I got up to watch the game at 3:30. Harden and Embiid were in average form at the beginning, but the 76ers' role players were in excellent form. Tucker scored three consecutive three-pointers, and Maxi Harris scored consecutively. It makes people panic a lot. But Tatum was in form early and scored high points in the first half. In the second half, Tatum scored consecutive points, three consecutive three-pointers, Jaylen three-pointers, Brogdon three-pointers, Xiaobai three-pointers... the game was completely spent. Tatum finished with 51 points, breaking the tiebreaker scoring record. There is no doubt that this is Tatum's night. In this round of the game, except for the devastating sluggishness in the first three quarters of G6, I think Tatum's performance at other times was completely qualified. Overall, he played very well in this series. In this round, Tatum averaged 29+11+5+1.3+1.4 per game, did not make many mistakes, and shot 45.3% from the field, which is fully qualified. In addition, I don’t know what kind of impact those three-pointers in the last moments of G6 will have on Tatum. Whether this will help him completely defeat his inner demons and become a better player is yet to be seen. Jaylen's game influence is as stable as ever, his shooting percentage is also very, very stable, his three-point shooting efficiency is incredible, and his performance at critical moments is also quite stable. However, Jaylen's problems are still the same. I wonder if there is room for breakthrough in the future. . Brother Gang is the most eye-catching, the soul of the team is the soul of the team, everything is self-explanatory. Brogdon was as stable as ever. Apart from the fatal mistake in G1, there were no major problems, but his performance on the defensive end did not meet my previous expectations. Xiaobai's condition is not as good as in the first round, and he seems a little timid at critical moments in key games, but as a role player, he is definitely qualified. The old man's performance on the defensive end this round is really outstanding. The restrictions on Embiid are completely beyond my imagination. The three-pointer is not that powerful. Of course, this is the 37-year-old Horford. What more can the fans ask for? The performance of the wheel is absolutely full marks. Lowe and Kagome also showed quite impressive performances at certain moments and are definitely qualified. After this series, what I look forward to most is Tatum. I hope he can really get better. In addition, as for the 76ers, I personally feel that Harden is already good. Although he has been stable in a few games, he is the second in command after all, and he also contributed two quasi-wins. Embiid... doesn't want to say more. 8 more wins to go! Let's goCeltics!",,,,,0,0,1,5/15/23 22:30,HUAWEI P30,['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/008l8Yf3gy1hdzft6d4tuj324x0zktf2.jpg'],,

I think there are three points that need to be improved, and we even need to play at our best level to win 🔝1⃣️Shooter group: The Heat's three-point shooting percentage has hit rock bottom in this series. Although the regular season is down to three points, I still don't believe this is the Heat's normal level. As long as the three-pointers maintain a certain frequency, the game will be much easier to play. Then at least some basic open mid-range shots must be grasped. 2⃣️Adebayor: Adebayor played very well in the last round of the series. He was able to withstand the three top players (Miro, Harteng, Landou), and integrated offense and defense into the inside gate. It is not an exaggeration to say that the two stars shine. I think the biggest factor that affects Reba is his mentality. His athletic ability is enough to make up for the lack of innate size to a certain extent. It depends on whether you can maintain your current state when facing the inner demon Luo Wei + Hu Fu, dare to attack in while defending well, don't miss the mid-range shot, and give your big brother enough help. 3⃣️Butler’s condition: In this round of the series, the big brother was in poor condition due to his ankle. The most obvious thing is that his mid-range and long-range shots dropped to a relatively average level. This is partly due to the ankle’s fear of exerting force. Of course, this is an uncontrollable factor. . Then the Knicks' double-team seemed to show the answer to the big defensive brother, and it was predicted that the big brother would encounter more difficult attacks in the next series. Whether you can break through the flanking attack depends on whether your teammates can provide too much help. In short, every subsequent game will be an extremely difficult and fierce battle.

How can you win with just Curry? The first round against the Kings was a microcosm of this season. He couldn't make shots, couldn't defend, and made frequent mistakes. After all, Bread has been with the Warriors for so many years. Without a space-oriented fourth position like Porter, he still has to play passing and cutting. Sabonis waved and handed over to delay the tactics, and almost let the Kings' shooters defeat him. Unfortunately, they were not accurate in three-pointers in the last game. In the win, it was only Curry's explosive power that allowed him to survive. The conflicts in the team's locker room began after Teacher Lu punched him. The most hurtful thing was that the video was released. There was no way around it. In order to appease Pu'er, the management offered him a big contract, but it backfired and Pu'er's performance was not as good as expected. The Warriors' management has always had problems, from handling the boxing incident to sending away the beloved Wiseman at the trade deadline in exchange for Payton Jr. Going back further is the famous Green formula. You want a championship and a future. How can such a good thing happen? West really didn't do a single thing after he left. I don’t know if today’s game is the last dance of the Trident. The team has too many things to deal with this summer, such as Green KT’s contract renewal issue, rookie rotation and training, Pu’er’s decision to stay, etc. Should they rebuild or continue to focus on When Curry builds the team, everything is unknown. In life, success is only temporary, and failure is the main theme. But how to face failure divides people into different shapes. Some people will be knocked down by failure, and some people will keep getting up and keep moving forward. And I believe you are the latter. I have watched you play since 2015, and I have witnessed you stand at the top and fall to the bottom with you. I think true maturity is not the pursuit of perfection, but the courage to face your own shortcomings. This is the essence of life.

After the big deal, it finally dawned. It turned out that it wasn't that Lao Zhan didn't delegate power, but that he couldn't grasp certain things. After the trade, the Lakers were united, and Lee also tried his best. After outstanding performances time and time again, he stood out among many defenders and occupied an important position in the starting lineup. It doesn't matter. When people talk about Xiao Li's contract extension, they always look down upon him, thinking that such a white player with no talent will be given for free in the playoffs and is worth 5 million in his lifetime. But Xiao Li took advantage of it. Ah, he broke out in the first game of his debut in the playoffs, which made the black guys shut up for a while, but Xiao Li did not give up and played steadily in the first round. In this round, they faced Shui Hua Cha's back line. In the first two games, they really couldn't keep up with the guards under the cover of the Warriors' movements. At this time, the sunspots had another climax, thinking that they were really useless. But the best thing about a smart person is that he has a brain and can adjust quickly. He quickly adapted to Yong🐶's routine. Not only can he interfere with the defender's shots, but he can even name-check the opponent's muscles, making him the leader of the second defensive team with a defensive difference of 5 votes. Not only can he call the shots, but he can even call for fouls. This really makes Zhan Mi and Hu Mi happy. I have to say that Teacher Su Qun is still accurate in judging people. Xiao Li, who has praised Xiao Li for a season this season, is really able to grasp it. In his 20-year career, Lao James has worked with countless role players, whether it was Mo, Big Z or Varejao in the Cavaliers 1.0 era, Chalmers, Birdman, and Battle during the Heat era, or in the Cavaliers 2.0 era. Della, JR, Frye, Korver, or the Lakers era Bob, Pony Ma, Green, Rondo, Caruso, etc., have all performed well, but people like Xiao Li are smart and reasonable, and can shoot. There may not be much that can be defended against. In the early days, Lao James had outstanding personal abilities, so he needed 3D players like JR, or shooters like Korver and Frye. Now Lao James is declining and is more willing to play without the ball. A comprehensive and calm ball-handler like Xiao Li It's indeed more appropriate. Finally, I would like to add that excellent talents may not be scarce in the NBA, but smart brains are indeed needed. Compared with Pu'er who boasts about the sky, the direct dialogue in this year's playoffs will make a judgment. There is no best talent, only more suitable team. The playoffs are still going on, and the Lakers' goals have not yet been completed. Wonder Boy's magical season is still going on. I hope the Lakers can create even greater miracles.",,,,,10,72,481,5/14/23 8:35,,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006ElzN8ly1hdxkctk8m2j30ew0ef3zp.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006ElzN8ly1hdxkcuhkaaj31hc0u07bh.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/ 006ElzN8ly1hdxkcv66njj30ku112jtz.jpg']",,
4.90E+15,N0rJKbHq6,1625895620,DeeperBBpro,"Regarding the upcoming Western Conference Finals, I personally think that the Lakers will face the biggest test since the series. The reason why they can easily win the Warriors in the semifinals is that their biggest advantage comes from the inside. From the thick eyebrow 6 From the data of averaging 14.5 rebounds per game, we can see his absolute advantage in the battle between the two teams. But... the Nuggets are different. Gordon, brother-in-law, and even Konchar include Teacher Yue Everyone in the league is not afraid of confrontation. Except for Coach Cephalosporin, everyone in the league knows that the biggest weakness of Big Eyebrow is physical strength. Therefore, even if he cannot be completely restrained, after this round of battle, Anthony Davis can still How much energy do you put into the offense?... This is 1. 2. The Lakers' current tactical system mainly comes from attacking the inside to cause damage, forcing the opponent to shrink their defense. Then the outside shooters set off an offensive climax... This It happens to be very similar to the Nuggets' tactics... However, although the Nuggets' wing defenders Bruce Brown, KCP, Braun and others are not as good as Zui Ge in their individual defense capabilities, in terms of movement speed and awareness of cover defense, . It can definitely be called the top... So, my personal opinion is that even if James is still unbeatable at the same position, countless regular season games have proven that when the team can only rely on the 38-year-old James to When scoring, they often end up swallowing the consequences of defeat.

I'm a Lakers fan, I'm a loyal Kobe fan, and I don't like a certain Ms. In the past, my TV stations were always on sports channels, and I usually used NBA games as background sound on weekend mornings. CCTV also liked to broadcast Lakers games. At that time, I was happy when I saw 24 people on the court, and it didn’t matter the record. (Actually, there was no record at that time.) Later, Curry, probably as the last giant to break out of the circle, faced off against a certain James for several consecutive years (and even won), and he regarded the Warriors as his home team. . (Probably they are fans of strong teams and championships. They won’t be fans after Curric and Clay retires.) I watched the Warriors’ games in 9 years back and forth, and this year’s Lakers-Yong battle was treated as the NBA Spring Festival Gala. Before the game, I felt that the inside line was going to be beaten by AD, but in the first game, AD was beaten by O'Neal. The Warriors have so many shooters on the outside, and the main thing is to look at the shooting percentage. Without the shooting percentage, and the defensive intensity and height of the inside line are completely overwhelmed by AD and James, there is basically no chance of winning. Weaknesses will be infinitely magnified. For example, Green, Looney, Payton Jr. will be left open from the outside, and Curry will be flanked. The result is a terrible shooting rate. At the same time, the Lakers' Rivers is beaten by Curry (Lonnie in Game 4). Walker beat Kobe), this is also the situation in the last game today. Basically, the Warriors are gradually withdrawing from the league's top ranks. Curry is getting older, Craiglin is declining, and there is no salary space. There is no salary space to operate personnel. Unless a big trade is made, but the salary must be matched, then what should I do? Which team are you watching? Okay, okay, after James is gone, of course I will continue to watch the Lakers.",,,,,0,3,1,5/13/23 19:31,iphone,,,

4.90E+15,N0oFh93HO,2294669081,Senior social guy,"One thing to say is that the Warriors stopped in the Western Conference semifinals and were eventually eliminated by the Lakers. The result was obviously disappointing and a failure. The collapse of the Warriors dynasty is close at hand! 1. Klay has been inconsistent throughout the season, and even more so in the playoff series against the Lakers. Klay will inevitably leave the Warriors and seek the last big contract of his career. In the small ball era, there will still be many championship teams competing for three-point shooters like Klay. So I wouldn't be surprised at all if Klay leaves and the Splash disintegrates next season. 2. Dream Green's performance this season is average, but in the playoffs, his performance is still good compared to last season. Green should take a salary cut and renew his contract. Although some teams will offer him a larger contract, if Green leaves the Warriors, his role will be much less than before. Immediately after the game, Green was negotiating with the Warriors for a multi-year contract extension. News of the contract breaks out. But like Klay, he already holds four championship rings, and the next contract will basically be the last contract of his career. Therefore, it is also a big team to pursue a big contract and also have a chance to compete for the championship. Probability event 3. Poole's struggling performance throughout the season was simply a disaster. Occasionally performed well during the regular season. But the performance in the playoffs was simply outrageous! Poole will definitely be traded. Poole's poor performance in the playoffs has proven that he is not suitable to lead a team. Although he has rarely performed brilliantly, he is completely unworthy of his worth and the team's expectations for him.

Ku Shui also compared the difference between Zenko's leadership in the show, and also commented on the old team Warriors. The first topic: The difference between James and Kobe’s leadership. Speaking of current teammate James, Russell said that James is more sociable. He said: ""James is better at getting along with everyone. He will communicate with everyone and is always socializing. Whether it is on the team bus or on the plane, he always communicates with the players."" Talking about the cooperation he had in the early stages of his career Of Kobe, Russell said the latter was quiet. He said: ""When Kobe and I were teammates, he was about to retire. I was sitting in a row with him, but he didn't talk to others because he needed to write scripts and stories, prepare to direct movies, and also read books. Or movies, in short, very focused."" When talking about the relationship between Kobe and the players on the team, Russell said: ""There were only 3 or 4 young people on the team at that time, and most of them had one-year contracts. To be honest, I I have never seen anything like this before. For example, everyone in a room is talking and the conversation is very lively, but when Kobe comes in, the room will instantly become quiet."" The second topic: Questions and positioning of last season The initial dissatisfaction was when Beverley talked about Russell's best shooting performance of his career last season on the show. The latter immediately became very excited when he heard it, saying that no one talked about this at all, what else do they want from me! Then Russell said in detail: ""They asked me to play point guard, so I will play point guard. What else do you want me to do? I shot 40% from three-point range. What else do you want? They want me to play the last two minutes."" Will you lead the team to win?"" Last season, Russell averaged 17.8 points, 3.0 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 1 steal per game, and shot 39.6% from three-point range. The third topic: When talking about returning to the Lakers and his expectations for the new season, Russell said that he had been traded many times in his career. As a result, when he walked into the team training hall, he felt that the security guards looked at him differently because The latter may also know that he is about to be traded. Then Russell joked that it was a good thing that he joined the Lakers as the third team instead of the fourth team (because Russell was originally selected by the Lakers). Talking about joining the Lakers last season, Russell said that the Lakers were in a vortex of public opinion at that time, and the outside world laughed at that Lakers because the team suffered various failures at the time. Therefore, for me, joining is like bringing new energy to that team, making the team smile again. The team also hit a climax, successfully entered the playoffs, and reached the Western Conference Finals. Although in the end They lost to the championship team, but this result is enough to make me excited. As for the team's goals for next season, Russell said that there are many players in the team's current lineup who can enter the rotation. He may provide points in a certain game, or he may provide 8 assists in another game. . If everyone can play the right basketball, the sky is the limit for this team. Whether it's Rui Hachimura or Reeves, they can put in a winning performance to make sure they make the playoffs and make sure they pick up where they failed. . The fourth topic: Talking about playing against the old team Warriors. Talking about playing against the old team Warriors last season, Russell said that the latter will always be a reasonable championship team because Cole is a basketball scientist and their entire coaching staff He is a scientist and can always come up with some different lineup combinations to achieve his goals.

4.90E+15,MFTmIcAfE,2294669081,Senior social guy,"There is a saying, if the Warriors stop in the Western Conference semifinals and are eventually eliminated by the Lakers, it is likely to trigger the disintegration of the Warriors dynasty. 1. Klay will inevitably leave the Warriors and needs the last maximum salary of his career. In the small ball era, there will still be many championship teams competing for three-point shooters like Klay. So if Klay leaves, I won’t be surprised at all if the Splash disintegrates next season. 2. Green should take a salary cut and renew his contract. Although some teams will give him a bigger contract, Green’s role will be great if he leaves the Warriors. Not as good as before. But like Klay, he already holds four championship rings, and the next contract will basically be the last contract of his career. Therefore, it is also a big team to pursue a big contract and also have a chance to compete for the championship. Probability event 3. Poole will definitely be traded.

We don’t understand it either, so I think it’s just too much pressure that leads to on-the-spot inaccuracies. Look at the shooting percentage of Rex Rabbit, and then look at Horford, Gerway, etc. who were let go in succession. They just couldn't make a shot. They turned around and were continuously fouled and made free throws by the Emperor. They had to sit on the sidelines before halftime of the game. Looking back at the Digital Team, everyone is alert and excited. Maxi is shooting like crazy. As a barometer of the team, his simplicity and efficiency make Tucker and others happy. In addition to his strong defense today, the latter also has three-pointers from the bottom line. Income. Of course, the most stable combination is the Emperor, especially the Emperor. Faced with different defenders, they use different methods of low-post singles. They hit hard top hooks, pretend to shoot and then turn back. They show off their dreamy steps in succession, and the opponent double-teams them. Neither was double-teaming. Coupled with Harden's stable control of the court, the game had already lost suspense before the halfway mark of the final quarter. However, the young Green Army is good at summarizing, and is also good at breaking up the battle of sinking boats. Think about this time last year, they were also defeated at Tianwangshan and forced into a desperate situation, but they defeated the defending champion in two straight games. I believe that Rex Rabbit will regain his form, and I believe that the Green Army's shooters will regain their sights.

4.90E+15,MFNajk3Lg,2541959385,Ah Shun talks about the ballSean,"The horror of the Nuggets' offense actually lies in Jokic himself and the tactical system derived from Jokic himself. After the small ball era began, the fourth position of most NBA teams has developed in the direction of greater mobility and stronger shooting ability, so they will naturally rely more on centers to protect the frame. In the Lakers' series against the Warriors, all of Coach Ham's changes on the defensive end were based on one principle - keeping the thick eyebrows under the basket. In this era, it is actually more difficult for centers to play on the defensive end than in any era. Not only do they have to face the better shooting range of offensive players, but more and more frequent body hair whistles make it easier for outside offensive players to break through, and they also face teammates. The help for the center on the defensive end has been greatly reduced. So in this era, at least in this version of the NBA, the Nuggets' offense will become increasingly unsolvable. Jokic has extremely strong low-post destructive power (players not at the center position will be eaten alive by him within 2 seconds. Of course, players at the center position cannot be guarded, but they can resist for a few more seconds), excellent shooting range ( Nearly 50% of his three-point shooting in the playoffs) and his unique passing talent. The presence of Jokic almost makes it impossible for any team's most important frame protector to stay at the basket. The passing and cutting system built by the Nuggets around Jokic has great hope of directly destroying the opponent's frame protection after the opponent's center is pulled out. Similarly, I am very unfavorable about the Lakers facing the Nuggets, because the thick eyebrows will almost be pulled out by Jokic in this round. Of course, this is a story for another day. The Suns, as the underdog in this series (although many people don't admit it, but they are), have now given up on the pass-and-cut system that restricted Jokic and the Nuggets on the defensive end, choosing to let some pitchers with poor defense come on and compete against each other. Fight against each other. Monty's determination actually yielded very good results. He created the best offensive conditions for Booker and KD while waiting for other shooters to pick up. Rivers, who is also a subordinate, obviously does not have Monty's courage and is still waiting for Harden to save his life. #lakes3-1 Warriors##Lonnie Walker 15 points##湖人gets the match point#",,,,"Lakers beat Warriors 3-1, Lonnie Walker scored 15 points, Lakers got match point",1,39,48,5/9/23 21:49,Weibo web version,,,

Messi, one of the crowned sports GOATs, won the title of 2023 Laureus Sports Male Athlete of the Year. This is the second time he has won this award in his career, and this honor once again clarified his ""historical status."" You can get whatever you want. Is there still controversy about the GOAT in football? Before last year's World Cup, Messi was already recognized as one of the most outstanding players in football history, but his lack of a World Cup championship has always been his most questioned and criticized ""pain point."" However, after winning the Hercules Cup, Messi was officially crowned the king of football, alongside Pele and Maradona, and became one of the GOATs in football. And Ronaldo, another of the ""peerless twins"", has already lost this unprecedented showdown due to his 0 World Cup titles in 5 editions. Of course, Messi not only has the World Cup, but also has 42 championships in various competitions, including the Copa America and 4 Champions Leagues. He is second in history in terms of the number of championships he has won, second only to Dani Alves, who has 43 championships. If he aspires to win the Ligue 1 title this season , will be tied, and Ronaldo has 34 crowns, which is difficult to catch up with. What's more, Messi has 7 Ballon d'Or awards and won the FIFA World Player of the Year award 7 times, both of which are the most in history. Now, he has won the Laureus Male Athlete of the Year for the second time, the only football player to win this honor. Perhaps only in terms of goals scored, Messi is still inferior to Ronaldo, but 30 goals is really not much different. Don't forget that he is two years younger in age, but his scoring efficiency is actually higher than that of the president! Moreover, he is about to surpass Cristiano Ronaldo and become the historical top scorer in the five major leagues. This is even more valuable, and he is only 11 goals away from the Champions League. So, Messi is the GOAT in football. Is there any controversy? No! The recognition from the Laureus Awards only reaffirms this fact. Historical status: One of the GOATs in sports is also the GOAT in football. Pele and Maradona each have their greatness, but their ""disadvantage"" is that they were not born in this era of social media. Cristiano Ronaldo, who has 500 million ins fans, is not as good as Messi in terms of personal and team honors. Therefore, Leo is the banner and representative of football. However, as the ""number one sport in the world"", no football player has ever won the Laureus Award before 2020. Therefore, when Messi won the award for the first time three years ago, he had already made history, and it was equivalent to getting "" The recognition of ""Sports Oscar"" allowed him to enter the palace. More importantly, Messi represents not only football, he is also the only ""three major"" player to win the Laureus Best Male Athlete so far, and the only collective athlete to win the Laureus Best Male Athlete! Basketball, volleyball, football, baseball, ice hockey, field hockey, etc., etc., no player has achieved this feat. Therefore, he represents the three major balls and collective sports to compete with ""aristocratic"" and ""elite"" individual sports such as golf, tennis, and F1. This is something that none of the NBA superstars have done. Curry ""failed"" this year, but he lost to Messi, who did it. Winning twice, Messi tied Nadal and Schumacher. Natto, like Federer (five times) and Djokovic (four times), is the GOAT in tennis. There are also three-time award-winning golf superstar Tiger Woods, four-time award-winning ""Human Speed Limit"" Usain Bolt - when talking about sports GOAT, these are names that cannot be ignored and must be mentioned, Messi At least standing side by side with them, he is one of the greatest superstars in sports history - of course, there are also some superstars in this hall who have not won awards due to age: Michael Jordan in basketball, Ali in boxing, and Tom in football - Brady, Gretzky in hockey, Phelps in swimming, etc. To sum up, this second award is more like a grand ceremony arranged by Lawrence Sports Academy for Messi to ascend the throne and be crowned the ""GOAT in Sports"", just like Charles III who has just officially become the King of England.",,,,Lawrence,8,39,171,5/9/23 8:28,,['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/88d90c69ly1hdrtqqg27tj20qo0qogsq.jpg'],,

4.90E+15,MFDTLaGhx,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[1. The second episode of the super board’s limited-time return; 2. Fighting between gods, see who can “become a human” first] Harden made a sure kill in overtime, finishing the game with 42 points + 8 rebounds + 9 assists + 4 steals + 1 block Cover, made only 1 mistake, scored 6 three-pointers, and once again had no answer for small mid-range shots and throws. After charging for two games, Brother Deng is ready again. Brother Deng can do it, and the 76ers will win. This rule is not accidental: it is known that the 76ers cannot theoretically guard the Celtics. In fact, the 76ers proved the theory by failing to defend for 4 consecutive games. So if the 76ers want to win, they must attack better; although Embiid is the 76ers theoretically with the most firepower, he can produce a guaranteed output, but he cannot continue to perform at the level of the regular season. The Celtics have a way Limit his output to an acceptable range. The 76ers can get an open three-point opportunity by using Embiid to be flanked. With a relatively high response sight, they can hedge against the Green Army's fixed-point three-pointer. The 76ers were unable to outperform their opponents in the field of scrambling and stealing points, and their opponents also had multiple secondary attackers scoring points sporadically. The 76ers must count on the main attackers other than Embiid to make contributions to fill the hole; Maxey and Harris face a Green Army-level defense, and it is difficult for either one of them to be effective. Besides Embiid, the 76ers player with the strongest development ability is Harden, and the Green Army's desire to attack him is obviously lower than that of Embiid. He is the one most promising to fill the scoring gap. This is a simple arithmetic problem that can intuitively explain why Harden must play if the 76ers want to win against the Celtics. The deeper reason is this: the Celtics are targeting the shortcomings of the two main players of the 76ers. The Green Army allows Harden to play one-on-one and pick-and-roll shooting, because Harden is now a better attacker who passes the ball than attacks; in turn, the Green Army will not let Embiid play one-on-one in the area below the free throw line. , and Embiid's passing ability may not always find teammates in the right position when the Green Army attacks and assists in defense. Although Harden can try to create a relaxed singles environment for Embiid, there will still be a lot of stagnant rounds where he cannot catch the ball and take action immediately, especially in the fourth quarter and overtime. It's extremely bad because the Green Army's help defense on both wings will not give him a loose space to play the ball, and Horford can get close to interfere with his shooting with few fouls - you can think of Embiid at this time as the postseason player last year. A copy of Durant. Backcourt players naturally have lower offensive costs than frontcourt players, not to mention the passing threat. The Green Army will not easily flank Harden. If Harden is online, the 76ers can easily break the game, because the 76ers also have a lineup with excellent space and many secondary attackers, which is very difficult to defend. Comparing the two sides, the Green Army's advantage is strong single defense, assist defense, and rotation capabilities. The 76ers' advantage is that the first two stars have stronger development capabilities (if Harden transforms). One can definitely attract double attacks, and the other can hit the ball. Excellent, the Green Army has no such ability. In this case, the two sides are actually close to a balance of power in terms of grand strategy. Therefore, in terms of grand strategy, the suspense behind is what Harden's status curve looks like: A. After 4 games in the series, Harden has two C and two pulls, and the crotch pull rate is 50%. If this is the probability, this round The rest of the series will be a 50-50 situation; B. Harden explodes in G1, G2G3 Mariana Trench-level stretch, G4 explodes, the rule is C one game and two games. If this is the pattern, the Celtics will take the series 4-2. Now that we’ve talked about the grand strategy, let’s talk about the details of employment. This series - and most of this year's playoff series - is heading in the direction of ""a puzzle that lacks a shooting threat and either hurts the team or is discarded."" After G3, I said, the 76ers should go to an extreme, like the Suns, and use more players who can attack you. In G4, Rivers took Jaylen McDaniels out of the rotation and lost another player without a space threat. However, PJ Tucker's time increased from 25 minutes in G3 to 31 minutes, eating up DNP Jaylen's gains. Half done. Tucker played a key goal today and was on the court for 5 minutes of overtime. He contributed two key offensive rebounds. It had some positive effects, but it still hindered the offense. Smart had a lot in the fourth quarter and overtime. The round took advantage of Tucker's excellent help defense on the court - including the offensive foul that caused Embiid - but because Harden can make long-range floaters and outside jumpers, this problem is covered up to a certain extent. Rivers may have no choice but to use Tucker. He still couldn't believe Niang's defense in the critical ball stage, and Melton's offensive presence was limited. The defense also made mistakes in the fourth quarter, so Rivers had to trust Tucker. But as long as the Greens don't make wrong matchups, Tucker's offensive problem will always exist, and it will be difficult for the 76ers to use Tucker's defensive gains to make up for their offensive losses. When Harden's jump shot cannot be maintained, this problem will be more exposed. obvious. In terms of details, this is a key point in the follow-up of the 76ers series. On the contrary, the Green Army encountered greater troubles in the details of employment this time. The result of Rivers not using Jaylen is that the Celtics don't know who is suitable to match up with Lowe after he comes on the court. The Green Army's long-standing habit is to let Luo Wei defend a wing puzzle that is not accurate enough for three-pointers and participates in few offensive scenes, so that he can go to the center to participate in assisting defense. Against the 76ers, there are two roles that are most suitable for Lowe's defense-Jaylen McDaniels and Tucker, followed by Reed. Since Tucker's playing time was staggered to a certain extent from Lowe's, and Reed only got 6 minutes in the game, Lowe, who played 14 minutes, sometimes didn't know who to guard. He can't guard Embiid, he doesn't have enough matchup resistance, and he's not suitable for outside attackers. He can easily be punished if he helps defend against Niang. If Majora does not plan to adjust the rotation time, then Lowe's time will have to be reduced to ensure that he bullies Reed. But if Harden is in good condition, Lowe may not be able to defend Harden and Reid from the pick-and-roll head-on. As the series progresses, the Green Army will have fewer and fewer rotations available. In addition, the Green Army must avoid wrong matchups. When Smart and Horford faced off against Tucker, their defensive performance was far better than when Jaylen and Brogdon played this role. However, in certain periods of G4, the Celtics did not do a perfect job in this regard. What will happen if Harden continues to be online and the 76ers really go on the offensive, or if Towers responds fiercely with three-pointers in the next 2 to 3 games? The possibility of this happening seems unlikely, but it cannot be ruled out. After all, after G3, we all thought that Harden’s nostalgic performance tickets were only for one game, but we didn’t expect that there would be a return game gift. Even if Harden only blows out one game later, this series will become interesting. I have a vague feeling that this summer will definitely not be peaceful. I have something to do today. I will just talk about some key points in another game. Don’t read it as an article: The Suns continued the strategy of G3, increasing the speed without ink. Durant and Booker immediately started working after receiving the ball. In many rounds, the Nuggets were too late to attack. Above; the Suns' current offensive position is too cool. Not only do Booker and Durant stand at the top of the arc, but they even stand on the strong side. When one is flanked, he immediately passes back to the other, reducing the risk of mistakes from going straight to the middle or from the bottom corner. It is impossible for the Nuggets to keep four players on the line. It means that the moment the big brother receives the ball at the top of the arc, it must be 1 vs. 1 - this is enough. Both of them have extremely strong pull-up jump shooting skills, three-pointers , breakthrough, and emergency stop mid-range shots are more than enough to deal with one fixed point; each other attracts flanking attacks from the other side, and each other takes the blame for the other side. Dubu's position and style of play means that he does not need any tactics to start his hand. He does not need to run without the ball, does not need to set up complicated screens, and does not need to deal with cards at a particularly high level. He can also create a 1v1 environment and truly play. The effect of 1+1 is greater than 2; the Suns no longer care about the restricted punishment of Shamet being tied up and whipped by Murray. Anyway, if you can't prevent it, then you can't prevent it. The two shooters Shamet and Rose got more time than Okogie. Craig abandoned it. Warren, who proved that he could score goals in the last game, continued to get time. Shamet finally made an open three-pointer. After overcoming his inner demons, it was unclear whether there would be a callback later; Booker's passing was too awesome. He looked for a cross pass from the weak side corner to pay tribute to 77. He also has the style of a gunman when he hits the ground and feeds the ball to the center. Durant continued to use Gordon to drag space and did some help defense, but it only covered a few wallpapers for the defense that was riddled with holes; Jokic had no solution, he just couldn't mature in the late stages of the two opponents. Under such circumstances, a normal performance of Murray can turn things around. Since neither side can guard the other, this series has gradually become like this: the contribution of both sides to their defensive strengths is not as good as the benefits of improving their offensive weaknesses, and their ability to lead defense has gradually become nothing. The last word is to score the ball from the hands of the big brother; only Jokic, Booker, Durant, and Murray can play the main offense. Although the defense on both sides is very stretched, for a main attacker with average ability, in this scene of the Olympian God vs. the Titan Giant, it is best to pull over and avoid it. The competition between the two sides is no longer who can score goals, but who does not lose; although it is difficult for both sides to defend each other, it is still important to defend hard-this may be why Landale is so good in this round-can get 1 more~ Two smart steals or successful interference, the situation will be different immediately; the Nuggets should not double-team Durant in the low post, or Booker's one-on-one facing the basket. In addition to being able to double-team the opponent's pick-and-roll calling Jokic, just stick to one-on-one defense in other rounds - after the Suns found the trick of shooting the ball to the other big brother at the top of the arc, the meaning of double-teaming one-on-one was gone, and it would instead allow the other big brother to gain A better starting environment. Moreover, it is difficult to make mistakes in this process, because it is too difficult to return the ball to the big brother at the top of the arc on the strong side; you can certainly say that the Nuggets and Suns are not very good defensively, but this is also due to the opponent's defense to a certain extent. The offensive level is too high. The offensive level of this group is unmatched by other groups. The four technical masters compete against each other smoothly and beautifully. If Xiao Hua wants to encourage offense, then encourage this kind of offense, an offense that truly competes in scoring ability. In the end, the two sides competed over who would fall from the sky first. They are all floating in the clouds, they are all gods, but if there is a big brother on either side who ""becomes a human"" first, the game will not go on.

4.90E+15,MFl2H69xc,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[1. The Suns fought hard; 2. The invisible assassin Horford and Harden, who can't slow down with his big move] 1. Who is the father of the Suns? Without Paul, the Suns still won G3 when they returned to their home court. Booker showed his usual performance in this year's playoffs, transforming into a destructive force and taking away the victory. Since the playoffs, Booker has averaged 42.8 minutes in 8 games, scoring 36.9 points + 5 rebounds + 6.9 assists + 2.1 steals + 1 block. His true shooting percentage is 69.5%, his assist-to-loss ratio is 2.39, and his efficiency unbelievable. Although Jokic's data on the opposite side is also very 2K, because we have long been accustomed to Jokic's high-end data harvester attributes, in comparison, seeing Booker's full explosion, the impression is still more shocking. Is Booker really not tired? The schedule saved the Suns to a great extent. G3 was 4 days away from G2, which relieved Durant and Booker's fatigue from the previous schedule to a certain extent, allowing them to play 43 and a half and 41 and a half minutes respectively in G3, scoring 86 points together to fill Paul's hole. , and then buried Ayton. The method is also very extreme - didn't you say that without Paul, the Suns would fall into chaos and only XJB would be left? Then do it! The Suns' game can be summed up in three words: fast - almost every ball is pushed at speed, and it is launched before the Nuggets' defense is completed. After receiving the ball without the ball, he immediately takes action or breaks away without any sloppiness; rush - either one-on-one without calling the screen, and in the pick-and-roll, just go to the other side of the screen and rush in 1-over-2. Booker's touch is online, he can't solve the emergency stop shot, and he also inspires his teammates in sudden points and pick-and-rolls. Durant didn't feel online, so he simply threw himself into the sky and got to the free throw line first; fight - the Suns worked very hard to protect the basket, Durant, Booker, and Landale followed one after another under the basket. Jin vs. Gang, they lost a lot of rebounds, but they didn't let the Nuggets put the ball in easily. Of course, except for Ayton's defensive rounds. The battle of life and death ended with a loss. G1G2 proved once again that it is too difficult for two people other than Paul - especially Durant - to play some tactical coordination in a serious manner. The Suns simply became unorganized and complicated and played fast and hard. , Keep it simple if you can, and don't give the Nuggets a chance to attack from a flank. In an ultimate fast whirlwind, two players, P1 and P2, raced all the way and passed the levels quickly. But the solar crisis has not yet been resolved, and in a sense, the problem has become even more serious. Previously, the Suns had no certainty starting from the 5th man. Paul's injury left the 4th man in doubt. Now Ayton played a game that angered both people and gods, forcing Monty to give his trust even more desperately after a desperate defense. of Langdale. OK, now the Suns are even vague about who the third person is. According to common sense, Monty needs to give Ayton another chance to prove himself, but it is difficult to figure out where Ayton's heart is. Will he rebound and avenge his shame later, or will he be defeated and lose? It all depends on his integrity. G3 Monty continued to try and see which puzzle piece would work best. Monty must have figured something out: Go to Uncle T's somewhat defensive but not very accurate 3D puzzle - I'm talking about you three brothers, Craig, Okogie, and Wayne Wright - you can really do it if you rush up to it. How is Murray doing? roll roll roll! Forget about Uncle T’s open three-point response shooting percentage, Brother Li, no matter how accurate you are in the regular season, the playoffs are useless; Forget about Uncle T’s talent and position, Ayton, Landale, Biyombo, you sent them to the appointment There were different styles of appetizers in front of Kitchen, so I might as well choose the one that’s hard enough. In addition to Payne starting in Paul's place and Landale finishing in Ayton's place, Monty also gave veteran shooter Rose a chance, but he was not very accurate. Monty re-activated Shamet, and Shamet also knew that his three-point shot was useless. This game had a dunk and a mid-range shot. I guess this was the reason why Monty used him - at least this guy is not just good at it. Three-pointers, these piecemeal offensive methods are better to occasionally respond to two than to never score open three-pointers. The same principle applies to Warren - you don't really think Monty wants the three-point shooting and defense of Warren, a reverse 3D player, right? Although Warren hit a corner three-pointer, my feeling is that if he can make two flick-forward floaters like the one at the end of the day, Monty can rest in peace. If he hadn't despaired of almost all players except Booker and Durant, Monty wouldn't have played such an extreme game. Booker acts as a grandfather every time, and Durant acts as a grandfather occasionally, using these two to death. other people? What other people? Where does the Suns have a third stable and usable person? Anyway, the current style of play of the Suns has completely changed into what the Duou Nets imagined themselves - the two kings stand on both sides of the arc, taking turns holding the ball and just doing it - the style of play is simple, quick to initiate, and the two kings digest the big blows. Some of the shots are purely based on the ability to score goals, so there is not much that others can do. No matter what posture they use, if they have some scoring skills and can defend well (regardless of their abilities), it will be enough. In the passer-by bureau, if you don't hang out the spring water and don't take the initiative to deliver it, then you are the father. Every game is played in a double queue. If you want to win, the two eldest brothers have to be superb every game. However, from the perspective of a neutral fan, the Suns game is really exciting! 2. In this series between the Green Army and the 76ers, the invisible killer Horford and Harden, who can't slow down with his big move, I said during G1 that the Green Army was not targeted enough. Tucker did not take any shots during the whole process, which meant that the Green Army was There was no effort in assisting defense. The Green Army corrected their mistakes in G2, and G3 consolidated the progress of G2. The Greens used Tucker to help defend the basket and did a lot of things, which disgusted Harden and Embiid. Lowe also provided excellent basket protection against Jaylen McDaniels. Because there are so many internal and external matchup resources, as long as the Green Army makes the right strategy and improves execution, the entire defensive performance and perception will immediately be different. The other end of the court is also an old plot. There is nothing wrong with the 76ers' main goal: Embiid is not on the court, and the team cannot protect the basket; Embiid is on the court, and the Green Army begins to target Embiid. The 76ers had more direct confrontations with Embiid in this round, which was a richer experience than in the past when ""the weak points of single defense on the perimeter were found, and Embiid protected the basket and the three-point line while focusing on one thing and the other"" - that is to say, Embiid was disgusted. There are more postures. Horford's presence in this game was not as strong as when he scored 17 points on 5 of 7 three-pointers. This is probably because Horford didn't defend Embiid enough. But Horford is lethal and cold-blooded every time he gets the shot. If Embiid is a little negligent, or the 76ers are a little confused when retreating and protecting rebounds, allowing Horford to catch a critical shooting opportunity, he can make the 76ers Fans are completely heartbroken. Horford has changed a bit from what we thought of him in the past. Although three-point shooting is a skill package he has long possessed, compared to the past, this version of Horford has become a lightning striker, making every move smoothly and shooting successfully. Fast and accurate. The Celtics' tactics do not rely on the center. Many times, Tatum and Jaylen work with Smart and White, and the offensive round is completed. This makes Lao Huo, who is ambushing in an inconspicuous corner, become More like an invisible killer. Before this 5-for-7 game, Lao Huo had only scored 7 goals in his past 29 shots. His three-point shooting that was too accurate in the regular season seemed to be showing signs of repaying his debt. However, the rebound in G3 denied this trend, so the Celtics' core advantage has not been lost - just as the thick eyebrows make the Lakers special, Horford is also what makes the Celtics special. Deng Ge pulled it, and pulled it very thoroughly. Shooting iron, slow breakthrough, Jaylen caught up from behind and sent Sakuragi to chase after him. In addition, there were a few mistakes. Some of the mistakes were due to Tucker taking up space, and some of the mistakes were simply because he didn't wake up. The 76ers didn't play much of the Harden/Embid pick-and-roll. At first, it was because Tucker was dragging space and was disgusted by Smart's help defense. The 76ers had a bad start. Rivers' first timeout adjustment was to take down Tucker. He knew where the weak point of the offense was, but he couldn't make up his mind not to use Tucker. After that, the Green Army became more and more playful, simply letting Horford guard Tucker, and Gu Wei and even Smart guard Embiid - Gu Wei sticks to his chest, Smart sticks to his crotch, and Embiid seems to have met Gong Yi's cherry blossoms. Konohanamichi didn't know how to use the right force at the moment - so Harden had to find Tucker to pick and roll if he wanted to find Horford. Maxey inexplicably named Tatum and was sanctioned because he didn't know who to use as a cover. Tucker later responded with 3 of 4 three-pointers, but overall, he still did more damage to the offense than he contributed, and Jaylen McDaniels was Tucker on the bench. The Greens used this in these two games. The effect of the two people is really amazing. Although Harden and Maxi's personal conditions are stretched, the Green Army's strange matchup arrangement really messed up the 76ers' accustomed starting style. Uncomfortable. Should the 76ers follow the Suns, throw away all the ""stuff"", and compete with the Celtics? Maybe this is the only way to go.

Coach Kerr's change of formation had a miraculous effect. JaMychal Green replaced Looney as the center of the starting lineup. His shooting ability added a shooting point to the team and gave the court a greater sense of space. In the past, Coach Cole would use a three-guard lineup, but this time he used JaMychal Green, who had never started. He is worthy of being a championship coach. G2 Thompson ushered in a big explosion, scoring 30 points on 8 of 11 three-pointers, Curry scored 20 points and 12 assists, Wiggins and Dream Chasing scored 11 points each, and J-Green scored 15 points. Although the Warriors' performance this season has been ups and downs, and their defensive ability and bench firepower have declined, this Warriors has mature playoff experience, a mature system and championship heritage, and it also has gods like Curry, Thompson, and Poole. The shooter is in the lineup. Coach Cole's ability to make on-the-spot adjustments is also very strong. Will G3 coach Cole continue this starting lineup? Or should Looney return to the starting lineup? After the Lakers won in G1, G2 was taught a lesson by the Warriors' three-pointer. In the G2 game, the Lakers did not play playoff-level defense, and the Warriors shot 50% from the field. The Lakers are a team that relies on defense to build offense. The defense is not online and the offense is stretched. Only James and Rui Hachimura have stable output, and other players have fallen into a slump. After the Lakers entered the playoffs, their offensive efficiency was 111 and their defensive efficiency was 103.9. In particular, their defense ranked first in the league. Big Eyebrow and James are key players for the Lakers. Of course, more players need to step up and share the pressure. One data shows that James only averaged 6 breakthroughs per game in this playoffs and averaged only 4.2 minutes of possession time per game. He knows that there are many ball handlers in the team. At the same time, as he grows older, his physical fitness will not control him for a long time. Playing with the ball, he added a lot of cuts without the ball, which also brought more changes to the Lakers' offensive system. The current score is 1-1.

A total of 4 players on the team scored in double figures. A 27:14 scoring wave in the final quarter finally came back to win. When Murray was in poor condition, Jokic supported the team's offense and once again produced outstanding statistics against Ayton. The Nuggets' balanced lineup is the key to their advantage in the series. If the outside shooters can maintain normal standards, the Nuggets have great hope of advancing to the next round. The Suns actually had a great chance to win in G2, but as Paul was injured and left the game in the final quarter, the team's organization was in disarray. The offense relied on Booker and Durant's singles to maintain their offensive performance, but the two were troubled by their physical fitness and their efficiency in the final quarter was poor. Neither was high, and the Nuggets eventually completed the reversal. Paul will miss this series, and the Suns are even worse when they are behind by a big score. The overall lack of accuracy on the bench is what gives coach Monty the biggest headache. Although the next two games will return to the Suns' home court, the Suns have not made many adjustments. Paul's absence requires Booker to take on more organizational tasks, while Durant needs to take over the team's offensive responsibilities. The problem after Paul's injury and absence was highlighted in the last game. Neither Damian Lee nor Payne can replace Paul. The team needs Booker to take over the organizational tasks. Obviously, it will consume more of him, and there will definitely be some problems on the offensive end. fall back. How Durant improves efficiency will be the key. For an older player who has suffered many serious injuries, playing full time in every game will consume too much physical energy. Returning to the Suns' home court in this campaign gave them 4.5-point data support. Having such support in the absence of Paul is obviously optimistic about the Suns' bottoming out. But the opponent is the No. 1 team in the Western Conference after all, and there will be no letup in the NBA playoffs.",,,,,0,0,0,5/5/23 19:31,NBA playoffs super talk,['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/00716j8Qgy1hdnqfapkvdj30hm09jjrv.jpg'],,

Guangdong, but I am lucky enough to like this estar from 2016 to 2023.

Being able to witness your favorite team climbing from the bottom of the mountain to the top step by step is the happiest thing for a fan. I don't seem to be as calm as a fan. I have never been to the venue, never watched their variety show, never done any support, and never had a quarrel with anyone in the comment area. Maybe I think that in e-sports, the only thing that really matters is performance, the championship is more important than anything else, and the public opinion of fans on the Internet has little impact. But later I gradually discovered that the support of fans is actually the biggest motivation for the players. The insults and belittling of others will also make the players gradually lose their confidence. You were once a dark cloud hanging over all teams. You have won five championships together. You have been a jungler, mid laner and roamer with seven championships. You have been a winger with five championships and one runner-up in your debut. You have been a shooter with six championships. Your honor can make almost everyone win. It’s beyond the reach of others, but if you want to wear the crown, you must bear its weight. Maybe you have defeated too many people, maybe it is the comments of extreme fans, or maybe people don’t want to see a nearly unsolvable problem.

The Warriors' shooters rely on pick-and-rolls, screen opportunities, and three-pointers. But when the Lakers defended the pick-and-roll today, they all squeezed through and chased, but the thick eyebrows just didn't come out. Then the Warriors got a lot of three-point opportunities. This is unnatural. Why would the Lakers do this? Because Ham wants to save Big Eyebrow's energy as much as possible so that he can stay on the court for a long time. As long as he is on the court, the Warriors are very afraid of his defensive ability at the basket and can suppress the opponent to the maximum extent. This was a big gamble. The Warriors were accurate with three points today, and chased points in a panic at the last moment, which almost made the Lakers' efforts throughout the game in vain. But the Lakers won, and Hamm may stick to such a strategy in the next game. This will test the long-lasting output ability of the thick eyebrows and the shooting stability of the Warriors. In the next game, Curry will definitely have an explosive output. It depends on whether the Lakers can withstand it. Lao Zhan will not remain silent.

4.90E+15,MEIWIaEHN,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[The Warriors and Lakers are evenly matched] The Warriors and Lakers played four times in the regular season, three of which occurred after the Lakers' big trade. The Lakers won all three times. The personnel of both sides in the three matches were not uniform, but there are some game details that are of reference value. Although they have played a lot of games after the big trade and experienced the test of the second-place Grizzlies in the Western Conference, this Lakers still has great uncertainty. The reason is that the Lakers' puzzle has a lot of variables. In addition to the stable core positions of Big Eyebrow, James, and Reeves, Russell, who has a relatively high overall level, is basically the fourth player. After that, there are question marks: Vanderbilt. The orthodox starter has great value in leading the defense and is seriously lacking in space. In the first round of the playoffs, Van Der Biao averaged 19.8 minutes per game, ranking behind substitute players Rui Hachimura and Schroeder. It can be seen that Ham uses him more sparingly, and he also knows that on many occasions, space is more important than the quality of defense. . Van Der Biao has a unique value. He can switch to guard Curry's pick-and-roll at certain times, making it more difficult for the Warriors to develop offense. Although the Lakers' defense is mainly about retreat this season, if the opponent is the Warriors, it is still worth trying to switch defenses at certain times; Rui Hachimura. The Lakers' important X-factor in the first round is their ability to punish mismatches with ball-handling shots. They shot 52.4% from three-point range in the first round, providing space value. It can be used as a meat shield to defend the front line, but this value is of little significance against the Warriors. His ability to switch to the backcourt and protect the basket is limited. The Lakers' main appeal for him is space, and by the way, they punish the Warriors' guards, but whether they can maintain the effect of the first round is doubtful; Schroeder. A defender who has the ability to hold the ball one-on-one, is fast, has mid-range shots and floaters, and is good at chasing down defenders. His type is useful against the Warriors. The question is, if he was not in good form in the first round, can he recover in the second round? It is reasonable to expect that Schroder and Hachimura will each make some corrections. If so, Schroder may deserve more time; Brown & Billis. The former is a poor man's version of 3D. He shot 1 of 11 three-pointers in the playoffs. He is not so tough at ordinary times and can sustain a little rotation time in the early stages of the series. The latter didn't feel good after coming to the Lakers, but he is still the most determined shooter on the Lakers' bench. He can serve as a screener and cooperate with James' named defenders; Gabriel & Walker. The former is a small-ball fifth position with good mobility and is worth trying against the Warriors. The latter can scratch his status when no one can make a shot. In the transition period, the Lakers can lead the team with Big Eyebrow and James respectively. The defense is guaranteed during the period of thick eyebrows, and the team has many defenders who can play and hold the ball, which makes up for the shortcomings of thick eyebrows. There is no need to worry during this period. During James' period, there are greater variables in which insider to use, but because of James' presence, the offensive continuity is better than the Warriors' period without Curry. The main variable for the Lakers is how to arrange the ultimate five-man group. We're assuming Russell is among them, and it's unclear who the final card will be. Because Schroeder is relatively balanced in leading defense and offense, he seems to be more suitable than Van Der Biao and Hachimura. However, the configuration of three guards + two frontcourts will reduce the physical pressure on the Warriors, causing the Warriors to dare to use smaller lineups. The risk of losing rebounds when guarding with thick eyebrows will also increase. The Warriors' employment also has major variables. The substitutes at the top of the rotation are these: Poole. He can play with the ball and has a certain breakthrough ability. He can shoot three-pointers with the ball when he is out of breath. However, he often cannot score in open spots this season. His shooting performance is extremely unstable, and his defense is the worst in the Warriors' rotation. However, because he can play and hold the ball, the Warriors still have to use him when Curry is not on the court; Payton. The Warriors lead the strongest defense off the bench, with excellent finishing ability and full of energy on both ends of the floor. Although he can sometimes respond to three-pointers, there is still no space threat. Against teams with poor rim protection, he can still find his presence through air cuts, but can Payton still be able to cut for dunks when his thick eyebrows are on the court? DiVincenzo. He can lead defenders with average speed and hopefully guard Russell and Reeves. He shot 39.7% from three-point range in the regular season and average in the playoffs, but he is still the Warriors' most promising answer to open shots. He is the one with relatively balanced shooting and defense in the Warriors puzzle, but he is also a defender. After the three guards, the Warriors' other available rotations, in order of appearance probability, are: Moody. In the first round, he shot 5 of 11 from three-point range and showed relatively good defense, ball handling and game energy. Due to his super long wingspan, he looks ""bigger"" than the three guards in front of him, relatively speaking. Some. Moody has no special strategic value, but he is relatively good at shooting and has good size. This foundation itself has value. Unless his hips suddenly stretch, he will have time; Kuminga, Lamb, and Jaglin. The Warriors' bench trio in the frontcourt each has its own problems. Kuminga can support James in the transition period, but he may be targeted by the Lakers' defense due to his lack of space and hesitation in handling the ball. Lamb is slow and short in lateral movement, calm in offense and shooting, but the three-pointers are sometimes accurate and completely missed. When Cole wants to put his hope in him, it means that the situation is extremely difficult. Jaglin will probably have time in this series. Although his overall ability is very poor, Looney or Dream Chasing may have someone in foul trouble. Jaglin is the only inside outside them. He has size, strength, and a certain probability of making the third team. point. There are two problems for Cole's employment: First, should he try the substitute frontcourt trio first? If someone's results are good, it will be of great significance to the subsequent games. Although the Lakers basically have a configuration of 3 to 5 reliable frontcourts with guards, the Warriors do not need to substitute 3 frontcourts, and will still have 1 to 2 less frontcourt rotations than the Lakers. Whether Cole dares to use three people to try out the effect in the early stages of the series is questionable; secondly, there is the space issue with Lu Lu on the court at the same time. How exposed will it be when playing against the Lakers? Although the Warriors finally proved that the starting lineup with which they were chasing Lu was still the best choice, they had wavered when they played against the Kings. There must be space considerations when Chasing Dream took the initiative to come on the bench. Sasha's inability to defend allowed the Warriors to eventually overcome the space gap and blow up the Kings basket, but it was extremely difficult for the Lakers, who guarded the basket with thick eyebrows, to do so. Once Zhui Lu feels uncomfortable together, there is still a question mark as to who will be the final piece of the puzzle in the Fifth Primary School. Porter, Belica. In my opinion, the most important confrontation between the two teams is to ""see who can't stand the space first"": the Lakers have thick eyebrows to protect the basket, James and Vanderbilt are two large frontcourts, and the very smart Li Jeffs provides assist defense. The Warriors are patrolling and sweeping, and the other five players also have a certain ability to help defend; the Warriors' main attacker mainly uses shooting style, including floaters and emergency stop jumpers, and can avoid protecting the basket to a certain extent, but the Warriors finish inside Too bad. The Lakers have better finishing ability. Russell, Reeves, James and the thick eyebrows who have recovered their touch also all have jump shot solutions. Who will be the first to make adjustments in this space game? This is important. If the Lakers make adjustments first, they will have to test the status of Hachimura and Schroeder. In particular, if Hachimura doesn't work well and the last card is Schroeder, then the Lakers will become a smaller team. The Warriors were able to heavily utilize their familiar starting five, which generally prevailed. If the Warriors make adjustments first, it is hard to believe that the three substitute frontcourts such as Kuminga and others will be better than chasing Lu one, and the addition must be another defender. The Warriors are too small, and defense will be more difficult. It can be said that whoever can't stand space constipation first will take action first, and the risk will be greater. Some other X-factors: Curry's foul numbers. Curry is likely to start guarding Reeves (to guard against DeBiao's size difference, and Russell has more ball rights than Reeves). Will the Lakers increase Reeves' role to consume Curry? Opponents have to commit 3.8 fouls on Reeves every game. How many will Curry lose? If Curry commits two fouls in a single quarter and four fouls in three quarters, the Lakers' situation will be extremely favorable. Reeves is likely to be the key to the Lakers' victory in this series; which side of the puzzle feels better. In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers shot 31% from three-point range, which is very solid. However, Reeves and Russell's combined sights in 6 games were okay, Hachimura delivered an explosive performance, and James made 8 of 41 with room for correction. . The Warriors shot 32.8% from three-point range in the first round, which seems to be a little better than the Lakers. This is mainly supported by the Splash Brothers, who mainly focus on three-pointers. The other pieces of the puzzle, except for Moody, are all terrible. Whichever side has more puzzle pieces and feels hot in this series, whichever side has more room for its generals to breathe; what is Poole's level? Although the Lakers also have talented players like Russell and Beasley, the former can pass and control when he is inaccurate, and the latter can DNP. No matter how well Poole plays, the Warriors will use him, and if Poole can't score, he will most likely hurt the team when he plays. The Warriors need Poole to play well to survive Curry's absence. If Poole picks up, the Warriors will have the upper hand. Overall, this may be the most watched second-round series in recent years, and it may also be one of the few playoff opportunities for Curry and James in their future careers. Both sides are evenly matched, and the outcome is unpredictable. Although fans from both sides have already fired in advance, I believe that after the series is over, the winning side will not spare the losing side lightly. But for fans who have witnessed an era, being able to have a high-level dialogue between them again should be a journey worth cherishing. I hope both parties will contribute wonderful performances.

4.90E+15,MEBLQ3POL,3901950092,Play ball with rice,"#curry50points# Cole said to Curry: ""We have 4 timeouts left, and we will call one to give you a rest."" In fact, Curry only played 37 and a half minutes in the end, and Cole had a small advantage. It will give Curry a breather in advance. Including the 2 and a half minutes after the game was played, Curry's upper limit of appearance will not exceed Booker and Durant's average time per game so far in the playoffs. However, we are aware of the difference in strength. Over there, it is considered a double row to open black, while here, we are basically supporting the overall situation alone. Curry took 38 shots, setting a career record in the playoffs. The 50 points he scored in the end was also a record. This was the most incredible firepower output in the history of the tiebreaker. You will not be surprised that it happened to Curry. , you will just sigh - finally, Curry will win a first-round playoff game in this way. This is like a condensed version of the playoffs in the final schedule of 2021. But although the teammates around Curry are not as good as in the championship season, they are much better than in 2021. Curry is playing alone, and it seems like he shouldn't be so alone, which is why this series is especially annoying. Cole is a master of public speaking. He interpreted everything Curry did as evidence of the championship. The value of these 50 points was expanded, its meaning was sublimated, and it became the driving force to move forward, injecting it into the already exhausted warriors. in the blood vessels. I hope that such a game can make the team understand what kind of existence they are following. Even if it is just from the perspective of witnessing history, if you record it in real time at the nearest position, it will be enough to answer 100 ""Sports Life Interviews"" in the future. ” and other announcements. They will all have a bright future, so why are you anxious? Of course, if I were a 20-year-old high-draft pick who gradually thought I had earned the coach's trust and suddenly found out that I didn't deserve to play in the playoffs, I would be unhappy. I will look for the gap between myself and my teammates in the rotation, watch the game video to ask the coach what went wrong, and then hone my skills and wait for the next time I am called upon. Unfortunately, I am much older than a 20-year-old, and my way of thinking is almost rotten. Moreover, for professional athletes, especially NBA players, the game experience in their golden years is extremely valuable. If you don't fight for it, you may end up somewhere in two years. This is indeed the painful part of being a high-ranking rookie on a team that pursues performance, and no one is happy. But if I already have a big contract and a championship ring, that's one thing. With both fame and fortune, fighting for status at such a young age must be such a greasy thing. When I look at Stephen, I have some envy. ""A man should be like this"", but he doesn't have to have the ambition of ""he can take his place"". After all, even the creatures in the pantheon can't even put together a plate of werewolves. Tell me. To catch up with them, I can do without the B-face, but I can’t live without the B-number. Curry expressed his attitude to the team-first by speaking, which he rarely did in the past. The loss of energy and focus in a game like G6 deeply hurt everyone related to the Golden State Warriors. It is hard to believe that the defending champion would perform such a performance at home at a match point where it is suspected that the series password has been found. But if you have watched all the Warriors' regular season games this season, you will realize that this is not surprising. It is just part of Golden State's intermittent convulsions this season, because the team has lost the ability to ""tighten up and close the game."" Absolute dominance, once it gets sick, the situation will collapse, and it will be ugly and shameful. Curry is really anxious. And, unlike the ""Sad Warriors Blogger,"" he doesn't want to end this chaotic season hastily. He spoke, he practiced, and then there was such a game. I can't think of a more convincing way of leadership than this. Riding alone among a million troops, killing seven in and seven out, without raising arms and shouting, there is no soldier in the three armies who does not follow the charge with tears in his eyes. If this battle can bring about cohesion, the meaning of 50 points will not be limited to promotion, records, and praise manuscripts shaking like snowflakes, and this season's Warriors will be more anticipated because of this. Cole should be secretly glad that he finally won the duel with Brown, and Steph went from being shared by the two to being exclusive to Cole. It's not that Cole didn't do anything. It can even be said that he used his brains no less than Brown in this series. However, in G6, when the series was already deep, Brown's changes stung Cole, which almost made him The head-to-head dialogue between the two resulted in a clear winner: Brown reduced Barnes' time and abandoned Ryan. The former provides forward defense that exceeds expectations, as well as stable single-handedly drawing fouls. The latter's rim protection in the transition period is highly profitable. According to common sense, the coach should continue to use them - but Brown chose to go forward; Brown left his trust to newcomer Keegan Murray, and Huerter, who failed to make a three-pointer in the series. After removing Ryan, Lyles was the center forward in the transition period to form a five-outcome lineup. Brown needs space because it is too difficult for the Warriors to break through in one-man defense. Improving space will weaken the Warriors' increasingly reliable help defense starting from G3. Huerter and Murray's handoffs and off-ball screens will target Curry and Poole, and Brown doesn't want them to be comfortable for a minute; more importantly, the lightweight Kings have increased the speed of the game to an incredible frequency range. . The King hit the Warriors with one quick baseline ball after another. Fox was as fast as the wind, and Monk followed closely. The Warriors' old arms and legs inevitably showed signs of age. In the later stages of the series, compared to experienced championships, the advantage of young people is vitality. They run, they attack, and they are full of a desperate desire for offensive rebounds. They want to exhaust the defending champion to death. Monk said that the Warriors are old. Monk is telling the truth. Curry is 35 years old and Tang Chai is 33 years old. For basketball players, calling this age ""old"" is a statement of the fact that they are older. But Curry cannot accept the extended meaning of ""old"". If it means ""no more"", ""finished"", ""no hope"", then Curry will smile like Duncan and promise ""the future is yours"" Promise, stay in this seat that you covet for a while longer. In G7, Cole made a final change. Rather than saying it was a change of tactics, it would be better to say that he put all the effective experience he had summarized before on the table. The first thing Cole did was return to the original starting lineup, take Green, and take Poole. This is not an unexpected adjustment. In the first 6 games of this series, the five-man team of Curry, Tang Shen, Wiggins, Dream Chaser, and Looney beat the Kings by 17.9 points per 100 rounds. They are still the Warriors' most valuable team. A dominant combination. Although Lu's five-man team can beat the Kings by 9.2 points per 100 rounds, just like last year's playoffs, the weaknesses of the three-guard lineup were seized upon by opponents, and the advantage became increasingly difficult to maintain. What's more, Poole is still a completely unmatched player. The crotch-stretching version. The Kings have taken advantage of the Warriors' space flaws, so why don't the Warriors break the game by filling up the space? G7 is not a game with limited options like G3. In G3, three guards can fight against each other. When it comes to G7, after enough samples have been accumulated, one must understand the fact that the King does not respect all Warriors shooters except for splashes, and except for splashes, Only Moody's has given some targeted responses. In this series, the Warriors' three-point shooting percentages are as follows: Poole, 25.7% Wiggins, 27% DiVincenzo, 33.3% Dream Green, 27.3% Payton, 28.6% Jagrin, Kuminga, Lan Mu did not score a three-pointer, 45.5%. When everyone was not allowed and everyone was released, Cole finally chose the old version of the starting lineup with better defense and better chemical reaction. It is natural. Cole uses Payton for the same reason. When no one has a space threat, he can follow Monk and finish better. Payton, who is more energetic, has his relative advantages. Moody, as the only one who can respond accurately to three-pointers, may deserve further trust from Cole. This will be discussed in the next round of previews. The second thing Cole did was to copy some of G3's successful starting moves, once again emphasizing the 45° support and coverage on the weak side. The reason why 45° on the weak side is important is because the Warriors were faced with a contradiction caused by the Kings defense: if Looney/Dream Chase goes down too fast, it will make it difficult for Curry to play the ball and increase mistakes; if Looney/Dream Chase goes down too fast, If the speed is too slow, the King will have enough time to close the bottom corner and help defend in the middle. When Curry changes the direction of the ball to 45° on the weak side, the defense that originally focused on destroying the connection between Curry and the screener is bypassed. The screener will also have a better view of feeding the ball to the side of the receiver than behind the receiver. Some, he can focus more on passing down, paying attention to the opponent's position to help prevent offensive fouls, and at the same time observing the cutting and movement of his teammates in the corner. This style of play is not limited to pick-and-roll, Tang Shen's 3+1 also falls into this category. Can the Kings' defense be cracked by adjusting their playing style? In the first half, 56 to 58, Curry scored 20 points impeccably, but the Warriors were still behind. The Kings responded to Curry's firepower output in various ways, but the teammates around Curry still couldn't fully convert his containment into scoring. Poor fixed-point response is a common pain for both sides in this series. The Kings, the league's No. 1 offensive player, are determined to continue the quagmire battle with the Warriors. Both sides are running and fighting breathlessly, with high excitement and high tension. They missed a lot in the suffocating atmosphere of the tiebreaker. Free throws, let alone how to maintain his long-range shooting skills. Only the most elite shooters can maintain confidence in such a game, and only the most elite scorers can find suitable means of output in such a game. The Warriors had no retreat, and neither did the Kings. Relying on the faith and dignity of the champions, as well as the strength of the home court and the aggressiveness of the newborn calves, they temporarily blocked out distracting thoughts, but the only thing left between their willpower and collapse was a series of consecutive losses. Points, hits and possessions lost. Now let's see where the balance is broken. So, in the third quarter, the situation suddenly changed. If I were Cole, I might feel a little frustrated. This round of the series, the tiebreaker, gradually started thinking about ""the essence of basketball."" If Miami fully proved to its opponents that they are the better team in the decisive battle with the Bucks, then the decisive battle between the Warriors and the Kings became a competition between the absolute ability of the stars and the team's desire to win. Curry - and actually Tang Shen - started with a very simple start, using his personal ability to infinitely challenge the Kings' defense. The picture is like this: a ball-free screen catches the ball, holding the ball in a small space and squeezing into the basket. , relying on the feeling of his wrist and fingers, Curry contributed the ultimate 2+1 on the ground to pick the basket; this ball is not easy to the naked eye, but Curry does not want to make other attempts, nor can he wait for the big open space after smoothly passing the ball and walking the ball. Respond or cut. If you can do it by yourself, you still have to do it by yourself. Therefore, we seem to have seen the reappearance of G3 of the 19th Finals. With the support of a simple starting position, Curry scored the points before the opponent's defense could react. Why did the king's attack come so late? Why did Brown choose to switch defenses instead of flanking when Curry named Murray and Lyles? Before the start of G7, Curry's main starting move was the pick-and-roll with position 5. Brown deployed a very strict flanking strategy. This was the focus of the game between the Warriors' offense and the Kings' defense in this series. In this area, Brown There is nothing wrong with the layout. However, before the start of G7, Curry only played one-on-one 16 times, and only scored 11 points in this way, which was not very efficient. Curry looks tired. Will he choose such a simple starting position frequently? Maybe Lyles and Murray can barely resist? Ryan has been abandoned, just need to protect Sabonis, and maybe everything will be fine. Brown was careless, and he should regret it, because he knew what Curry was capable of. In the latter part of the fourth quarter, Brown used Sanno Industries' defensive strategy against Miyagi, flanking Curry from the backcourt, and respecting Curry with the highest standards of treatment, but was unable to restore the defeat - in the process, the Kings could not even A mistake took away the Warriors. Curry shuttled back and forth, stumbling to keep the ball around his body, but the Kings couldn't get it away. In G6, Curry made 5 turnovers. In this series, he averaged 3.3 turnovers per game. In G3 and G7 on the edge of the cliff, Curry only made one mistake. In these games, he has more possession of the ball than usual, has a heavy responsibility, and has no retreat. He said that he had been reminding himself not to make mistakes, and the string tightened, and he really did it. Is this enough? You can't beat a team by yourself, not even in a game like this where the basketball god is on top. But how do we evaluate the teammates around Curry in such a game? I tried my best, defense + rebounding, and supported Curry in the way I could, but it did not include the more ""advanced"" parts and the parts you expected. This was the half-time game where Cole was silent and Miles was in tears. The Warriors are not the Warriors in the game of superstar singles + rebounds. The team that hit the most three-pointers in the regular season is so stubborn that it can only make half of its free throws. The awareness of ball-playing in the small space under the basket does retain the traces of Cole's coaching, but more often than not, all you see is the attitude - Looney has 9 front boards, Wiggins has 4 front boards, and the two of them have 10 in total. Stepping to the free throw line for the first time, he felt a sense of desperation. These points were not obtained cleanly. If Wiggins and other outside shooters could hit three-pointers, Looney's downward finishing would be more powerful and it would not have caused such trouble. But it makes no sense to find faults with players' technical characteristics now. The fact is that in this kind of game where everyone's hands are shaking, players other than superstars can make the biggest contribution. In addition to defense, it is these and hard work. Competition content related to vitality. Looney is the benchmark in this regard, and Wiggins and Payton can also make supplements on some nights. Where they lost in G6, G7 became the key to their victory. Send yourself into the air, fight, and grab. This is the attitude of the people around Curry. Working with Curry forms the final trump card for the Warriors at the critical moment of life and death. This isn't the first time you've seen this, there was no shortage of games like this in last year's finals. I love a game like this, but I'm sad to see it happen in the first round, and if it doesn't happen, the Warriors' season may be over. The contribution of the new force is Poole's 33.8% shooting rate and defense that was beaten immediately, as well as Kuminga's DNP. Moody's qualified 3D performance in 65.4 minutes was the final tenacity of the Warriors' youth army and the relief of their fans. The contribution of the new players was that DiVincenzo was unable to defend the Kings' defenders and lost his three-point magic in the regular season. Payton is useful, and he shouldn't be inexplicably criticized by fans, but he is not as useful as the Warriors expected, at least not as useful as Saddiq Bay is to the Hawks. Lamb and Jaglin, they did last a few minutes of rotation time in the game when Chasing Dream was absent, but that was it. OK, so, what did the Warriors gain this season? Most likely it just proved to Lacob once again the real reason why this team is great. Curry deserves all the praise, but the Warriors still have a long way to go. I hope the Warriors will not let this down. Curry, as well as every player who is tough but tried their best, will give everything they have to win.",,,,Curry 50 points,0,0,0,5/2/23 2:59,iPhone 8 Plus,"['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/laarge/e893088cgy1hdjgvscfysj20qo0HSN95.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/e893088cgvrybaxj20q20q o0d8dn2.jpg ',' https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/ e893088cgy1hdjgvsojw3j20h80bhjxy.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/e893088cgy1hdjgvtgzqvj20nc0d4qcj.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/e893088cgy1hdjgv tygrmj20n00mwn5l.jpg']",,

A strong delay requires a player on the inside to cover the center in the pick-and-roll in time (in picture 1, the Kings players are all watching the show, in picture 2, I am covering in time), and the vacancies in other positions place extremely high demands on the rotation speed, which is slightly slower.

According to ESPN reporter Tim MacMahon on April 30, sources revealed that the Grizzlies management is already trying to replace Dillon Brooks. Dillon will become an unrestricted free agent this summer and is the only player in the Grizzlies' regular rotation who is not under contract next season. According to sources, the Grizzlies tried to trade Mikal Bridges in February with a package that included four first-round picks, and also showed great interest in OG Anunoby, but failed to enter. formal discussion. The Grizzlies have selected three forwards in the first round of the past two drafts, including 2021 lottery pick Zaire Williams, 2022 No. 19 pick Laravia, and David Rowe acquired in exchange for Melton. Dee (No. 23 pick in 2022). All three have shown promise, but none are considered ready to replace Dillon in the starting lineup. But regardless of whether the Grizzlies have found a replacement for Dillon, the front office must determine whether keeping Dillon is in the team's interest. While Dillon means a lot to the Grizzlies defense, where he's the league's third-best defensive scorer, he hurts the team offensively and is a poor shooter. Dillon shot 39.6% from the field and 32.6% from three-point range in the regular season, and it was even lower in the playoffs. His shot selection often frustrated the coaching staff. Dillon also had a quarrel with ""Dream Chase"" Green through the media, and had a similar quarrel with James. After the Grizzlies were eliminated, Dillon left the arena without taking questions from reporters, marking the third time in the series that he failed to fulfill his NBA-mandated media responsibilities. Dillon has been suspended three times this season, twice for accumulated technical fouls (a league-high 18 times) and once for intentionally hitting Mitchell. Dillon created controversy in each of the past two playoff series when the Grizzlies were eliminated, and the chaos was unacceptable.

4.90E+15,MEqaccen4,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Looking at the scene, the Heat and Knicks don’t have an absolute advantage, but...] Due to time constraints, I will briefly talk about this round of preview. The Heat played against the Knicks 4 times in the regular season, and the last 3 times occurred after the trade deadline. Neither Love nor Hart was absent, which is more reference. In these 3 games, the Knicks won 2 times, but the score difference was not big. It can be seen from the scene that neither team has an absolute advantage. Now, the situation has undergone some subtle changes-it is impossible to measure the level of the Heat. The Heat's three-point shooting percentage in the regular season was 34.4%. In the first round against the Bucks, this number soared to 45%. A change of more than 10 percentage points in the three-point shooting range is enough to turn the league's bottom offense into the league's top offense. Now we have to guess what will happen after their three-point crosshairs. According to common sense, the hand will not always be hot, and the hit rate will inevitably return to the mean. Will the character be restored to the limit, and the next round will be all kinds of irons? It's hard to say, because many of the players the Heat failed to score in the regular season are indeed shooters. Although their rebound in the playoffs was too violent, it cannot be said to be absurd. In addition, last season was a completely opposite story: in the regular season, the Heat shot 37.9% from three-point range, ranking first in the league; in the playoffs, the Heat shot only 31.3% from three-point range. In the three-round series, the three-point shooting percentage was 34.4% against the Hawks, 29.8% against the 76ers, and 30% against the Celtics. They were talking about it at the time, and the Heat might pull back on their shots at some point, but they didn't wait until they were out. Therefore, it is also possible that the Heat's character conservation will be reversed, from the regular season and the playoffs to repaying debt, to the regular season and character accumulation and the playoffs. Well, you can't predict the law of conservation of character, but there is one thing - the Knicks are indeed a three-point team. In the regular season, they give their opponents a very high proportion of three-pointers, and their opponents' three-point shooting percentage is also the highest in the league. allow. In the first round of the playoffs, the Knicks' defense strategy against the Cavaliers was also very clear. They completely disrespected the Cavaliers' forward line. The Cavaliers' positions 3-4 were really not even a 3D with good shooting skills. The Heat have completely different configurations from the Cavaliers. In their rotation, the shooting ability is as follows: The clear positioning is shooters: Duncan Robinson, Strus, and Love. They may not be accurate with their high three-point output, but normal teams will not let them go on a large scale, especially after watching the sequel to ""The Death of a Buck""; guards who shoot a lot of three-pointers: Lowry, Vincent. Their three-point production is also very high, which may not be accurate, but they have the ability to hold the ball and can break through, make ball moves, and make pull-up jump shots; an open response striker whose three-point production is not high: Martin. During the regular season, he shot 4.1 three-pointers every 36 minutes, shooting 35.6% from the field. He will definitely be released. For the Cavaliers, this level is basically the three-point level of all the so-called space points on the wings except for the three outside attackers of Mitchell, Garland, and LeVert; they usually don’t shoot three-pointers very much, but they are good in key games in the playoffs. The one who entered: Butler. I'm not qualified to evaluate Butler's ability. I can only say that even if Butler can't maintain the incredible three-pointer in the first round, with his calmness and ability, he can still solve some problems with sudden points, fouls, and hand-to-hand coordination. Question; A center who doesn’t shoot three-pointers but has a mid-range shot: Adebayo. It can be predicted that Reba has just come out of the tiger's den and entered the wolf's den. Meeting Mitchell Robinson will not be much easier than meeting Da Luo. But compared to Allen and Mobley, Reba still has a mid-range shot and support. He can still arrange the inside by going to the top of the arc to hand off the ball. It’s not easy for the Knicks to use the method against the Cavaliers - rely on Miro/Harten and other off-ball defensive points to shrink the basket, play with Mobley and Allen who have no range, and avoid Mitchell who is being flanked. , Garland, and then watch others strike - against the Heat. The Cavaliers' player who participates more in screening at the top of the arc is Mobley. His opponent Randall can directly flank the ball carrier, forcing Mobley to handle the ball smoothly, allowing Milo to squat under the basket and the wing under the basket. The defense goes to get Mobley and Allen. But the Heat's player who participates more in tactics at the top of the arc is Reba. Milo can't be flanked, leaving Randall behind who can't protect the basket. If you stay inside, you have to bet that the Heat can't make a shot - as long as the series is long enough, You can definitely bet on whether the Cavaliers can make the puzzle, but whether the Heat can make the puzzle, only God knows. In addition, New York couldn't restrict Mitchell purely by relying on single defense. Mitchell was defeated by double or even triple attacks. It is not safe to use the same method to create space around him to support Butler who is better. Moreover, Butler has many tricks in his hands and handles the ball well, so he is not so flanked. Several of New York's leading defenders, including Grimes (who is expected to be in short supply) and Bartley, may not be as good as Holiday in terms of individual defense capabilities. Hart has enough strength but not enough height, so it is still difficult to restrict Butler. The Knicks actually defeated the Cavaliers on defense. They prevented the Cavaliers from scoring in the 90s. But this is also because the Knicks' defensive strengths are too restrained for the Cavaliers' offensive weaknesses. The Cavaliers can't beat the shield with their fists. The Heat happen to have a ""Tai Chi"" style of play, and they can bypass the shield to a certain extent. However, the Heat's ""Tai Chi"" style is sometimes Zhang Sanfeng, sometimes Lightning Five Whips, and it is difficult to predict whether it is accurate or not. So, can the Knicks' offense break down the Heat's defense? The Knicks ranked second in offense in the regular season, met the Cavaliers, who ranked first in defense in the regular season, and finally handed over a lower-limit offensive number. Their offensive efficiency in the regular season was 118.7, and this round it was 110.4, which is still a significant downgrade. After all, the Cavaliers have twin towers to protect the rim, which also caused many mistakes for the Knicks. The way the Knicks ensured their offensive bottom line was that they grabbed an incredible 39.6% offensive rebound rate. Milo was stunned to steal the Cavaliers' two inside players into two inside players. Let's think back to the Heat's play-off game against the Hawks where the backboard was blasted. It seems that they are in some danger. However, that man has changed the balance again - against the Hawks, Love basically didn't play much, and now he plays more than 30 minutes a game. The Heat will use Love against Milo, and Love's biggest defensive advantage is rebounding. In the regular season, the Heat played against the Knicks. When Love was on the court, the Heat's defensive rebounding rate was 76.7%, which is a good number. In addition, the Heat's matchup style just restrained the Knicks' starting-hand habit. The Knicks mainly play the 1/4 pick-and-roll. Assuming Butler is guarding Bronson and Reba is guarding Randle, they can directly switch to guard against this set of pick-and-rolls. If Bronson asks Miro to cover and call Love, Love can force the delay, or he can directly flank Bronson to test Miro's subsequent ball handling. Harten's follow-up processing ability will be stronger, but his defensive dominance will also be weaker. Barrett can provide some ball-handling punishment, but he's unlikely to be better than Middleton against Vincent, and the Heat can live with that. Starting lineup, the Heat are not afraid of the Knicks. But the Knicks' depth is very good, and Hart, Quickley, and Harten on the bench are not in vain. During the Heat's single inside period, rebound protection is a problem, and some zone defense support may be needed. Love's single inside period may also be punished by the Knicks' breakthrough ability. The Heat must strive for this period of time to use the space environment to attack. If they can not lose too much during this period, the Heat will have a chance. The Heat's shooter's performance is unpredictable, and I don't know how many weeks Bashen's Jordan experience card has been recharged. These two X factors are jumping up and down, allowing them to be ranked first in the Black Eight League, and to be beaten in the play-offs. Normally The net victory of the game is divided into negative numbers. If they pay off too much first-round debt, they really can't beat the Knicks. But at least at this point in time, I choose to believe that the Heat, with their eight-digit power, will not be afraid of the Knicks in terms of lineup characteristics.

The best result before the trade was only 11th in the Western Conference, and they had never entered the play-offs. With such a Lakers, no one thinks that the Lakers can achieve something this season. The best hope is that the Lakers can enter the play-off list and join the playoffs. However, this is the kind of Lakers that, after the trade, had the league's best winning percentage, rushed from 13th in the Western Conference to seventh in the Western Conference, went from the bottom of the offense to a top 15 offensive team, and finally ranked first in the play-offs.

4.90E+15,MEfHF9D9e,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Facing the Suns, who have the advantage, do the Nuggets have a chance? 】The Nuggets played 4 games with the Suns in the regular season and drew 2-2. None of them had reference value. The first two games took place before the Suns' big trade, and the Nuggets won both of them. However, the Suns suffered too many injuries in G2 and had a water-cooler lineup. At the beginning of G1, the lineups of both sides were relatively neat, but Booker retired injured in 4 minutes. The game went into overtime, and Shamet scored 31 points to make up for Booker's output. Although the last two games took place after the big trade, Malone couldn't afford to take a rest. It is difficult to analyze a series that lacks direct confrontation cases in the current season. However, the Suns and Nuggets are also old rivals. The two teams met in the second round of the 2021 playoffs. The Nuggets, who lacked Murray, were unable to fight back and were swept 4-0. It is well known that Jokic cannot guard against the pick-and-roll driven by the top backcourt. In the past few years in the playoffs, the Nuggets faced teams led by top backcourt stars. Their opponents' offensive efficiency was: 121.9 against the Warriors in 2022; 121.9 against the Trail Blazers in 21 , 122.1; against the Suns in 2021, 122.1; against the Jazz in 2020, 120.3. With a large enough sample, it's hard to believe that this time will be an exception. There are two questions: Question 1: The Suns' restraint of Yokic's pick-and-roll defense has broken through the ceiling. So, how high can the upper limit be? I can already imagine Teacher Yue's face flushed by the sun's mid-range relay. Zubac has already demonstrated this before. In this round between the Suns and the Clippers, when Zubac was on the court, the Suns' offensive efficiency was 125.6. What is the concept? The Kings, who ranked first in offense in the regular season, had 118.6. Throughout the series, the Suns' offensive efficiency was 122.5, ranking first in the playoffs. In the series between the Nuggets and the Timberwolves, they did a good job of limiting the opponent's offense. They have tonnage and height inside, and strong rebounding ability. As a twin-tower team, it is not surprising that the Timberwolves can't do any damage when they encounter the Nuggets, but Edwards' performance Luneng averaged 31.6 points + 5.2 assists per game, with a true shooting percentage of 60.2% and an assist-to-loss ratio of 3.25. You can recall Huazi's helplessness against the Lakers, and his inability to serve as the first starter in more samples. Playing against the Nuggets, his advantages can be brought out. It is very likely that the Suns' guaranteed offensive efficiency this round is 120. Question 2: Can the Nuggets make some targeted adjustments to try to take advantage of the Suns' fifth man problem? In the first round of the series, Director Lu insisted on using Zubac but also used some brains. He tried Zubac against Craig to make it more difficult for the Suns to train him. However, Craig shot 55.6% from three-point range, completely responding to Lu's strategy. As a result, he failed to defend the front pick-and-roll and allowed his opponents to achieve fixed-point efficiency. Craig may not be able to maintain such an abnormal response in the second round. Even so, it is not easy for the Nuggets to use their brains on matchups and defensive strategies. Although the Clippers were absent from George, they only played two games, and Lu did not reuse Jigsaw forwards who could defend. Anyway, most of the backcourts they have are strong and tough in matchups. Westbrook surrendered when guarding Durant and Booker. A very eye-catching performance. There are three main matchup points for the Nuggets - Gordon, Pope, and Brown. If you have to add another one, Braun, a newcomer who has little time. Gordon and Pope should be one leading KD and the other leading Booker. Gordon has a strong body and sufficient size. It's hard to say whether he can effectively limit KD, but he can do it by reducing the number of double attacks. When Pope was with the Lakers, he couldn't restrict Booker much when playing with the Suns. It can only be said that he is more suitable than others in the Nuggets. The Nuggets also have two less strong single defense points, Murray and Porter. For Murray versus Paul, it's not a big problem to keep up with one-on-one defense. He can't switch defenses when guarding pick-and-rolls. He squeezes through the screen and tries to interfere with the mid-range shot, but he still has to rely on his own personnel and fate. Porter has to shoulder enough assisting defense tasks against Craig or Okogie, which is a big test for him. It's not that easy to expect Mr. Yue to successfully flank on the line and force the ball out of the pick-and-roll. If the teacher lifts the ball too high, there is a risk of being passed. If it is not raised high enough, it will not interfere with the shooting. A moderate position is the most ideal situation to prevent the sun pick-and-roll. The Mavericks did this last year. Can the Nuggets do it? Judging from Mr. Yue’s past experience in preventing pick-and-rolls, this is difficult. Letting Mr. Yo play against Okogie or Craig to reduce the chance of him mentioning online defense may be a strategy that can be tried. But firstly, there is the risk of being responded to by a three-pointer, and secondly, it will be more difficult for the Nuggets to match up in other positions. If Teacher Yue doesn't guard Ayton, he can only guard him. Porter can't go against Ayton. The key is not the single defense effect, but that he will be trained by pick-and-roll players. Gordon pulls Ayton, and Porter can only face Durant. Not to mention whether one defense is good or not, the Suns playing Cannon and Budu pick-and-roll are enough for Porter to drink a pot. If you look around, you will find that it is unrealistic to expect the Nuggets to defend against the Suns. As Jokic said, the Nuggets need to pray to defend against the Suns. They can keep their strengths (rebounds, less fouls), be more active on defense, try not to lose points that they shouldn't lose, and don't lose their mentality if they lose points that they can't guard in the first place. Then go to the other end to regain the field. The Suns are also not easy to defend against the Nuggets. Depending on whether they use Okogie or Craig, the matchup methods may be different. For example: Okogie defends Murray, KD defends Gordon, Booker defends Porter, and Paul defends Pope; Craig defended Gordon, KD defended Porter, Booker defended Murray, and Paul defended Pope. This is just a preliminary plan, and the actual results will depend on the actual results. There is no obvious relationship between the Suns and the Nuggets. It is difficult to defend only because the Nuggets' offense is too strong, and the Suns' single defense and assist defense are not strong enough. If the Suns' offense and the Nuggets' defense are an elemental reaction, then the Nuggets' offense and the Suns' defense are pure damage from the rock attribute main C. I can't think of what kind of starting style the Nuggets will use as their main focus. They can play with Murray in the pick-and-roll, with teacher in the low post, with teacher Gordon in the high-low post, with teacher Porter in the hand-off, etc. It can be played any way. In the first round of the playoffs, Ayton's performance on the defensive end was extremely eye-catching. He made almost no defensive contribution, and the team's perimeter defensive breakthrough ability was insufficient. In some games, the Suns were blown away by the Clippers at the basket. Thinking about the fact that the Nuggets have an appointment with the giant teacher, it seems that Ayton will not have a hard time in the second round. My feeling is that Ayton will feel uncomfortable, but at this point he will not be killed. Ayton's defense has the following characteristics: off-ball defense is extremely poor, and it is a disaster to match up with a shooter-type inside player; against a heavy center who often appears under the basket, he may be uncomfortable and explode the rebound; matchup or coordination When defending, he will be crushed or actively dodge when encountering a very high-impact outside attacker; but when he defends against less impactful pick-and-rolls and singles, his effect is not bad. After all, he has the size and mobility. Ayton's defense against Jokic over the years can be summed up as - he can't guard but he can watch, which is better than the average center. In addition, the Nuggets are the team with the fewest breakthroughs in the league. They will not use a bunch of strong and fast guards like the Clippers to use the space of the five-out lineup to rush in from all aspects. Murray's style of play that ignores the environment by being able to lean back in all positions, Porter's big pull-up, and Jokic's talent for scoring goals from various postures. These are not things that the Suns can limit, but they can be summarized as digging. Jin's offense is strong enough, but the Suns do not have top-level defensive resources. Top-level offense can naturally break through ordinary defense, but it is not a restraint relationship. What the Suns may want to pay attention to is that the Nuggets may use Aaron Gordon to be aggressive and accelerate the consumption of KD. It is unwise for the Nuggets to compare jump shots with the Suns. They use height and hardness to threaten the basket and shoot out KD. A game with more magic balls and more rebounds will give you a better chance of winning the game. So, which side has the greater advantage? Restraint cannot be ignored. The sun may have an advantage in the general direction. But they also have hidden dangers. In the first round of the playoffs, Murray and Jokic averaged 38.4 and 37 minutes per game, while Booker and Durant averaged 43.1 and 43.8 minutes per game. The Nuggets are famous for relying on starters and poor depth. The Suns are one of the few teams that is more exaggerated than them in this regard. Monty can't find enough reliable substitutes at all. As long as one of KD and Booker comes off the court, the Suns will He was losing points in the first round, so he beat Booker and KD hard to survive many games. Will this way of playing against the Nuggets be maintained? The Nuggets don't have the depth of the Clippers. The Nuggets' connection issues in the first round were not exposed, and the Timberwolves' bench is really weaker. But after Jokic comes off the court, their level of military training will also decrease. Both sides will split some of the starting lineup and bring substitutes, and it is difficult to predict who will win in the transition period. This result is very important - the Nuggets faced the Trail Blazers in the 2021 playoffs. The starting lineup did not take advantage and relied on the substitutes to win. However, their substitute lineup at the time was not very good, but they caught up with the Trail Blazers and the substitutes were completely incompetent. . If the Suns have difficulties in connecting, Booker and KD will have to maintain high playing time, which will become a hidden danger for the Suns in this year's playoffs, especially KD. As a veteran who has suffered serious injuries, his health and energy will become a problem for the Suns. Huge X factor. If I were Malone, I would attack KD heavily and put pressure on this point on both offense and defense from the beginning. Overall, I think this is a very close series. The Suns have a more stable restraint relationship. Although their substitutes are very weak, the Nuggets happen to be not good at this. Payne's return will also alleviate some of the Suns' depth problems. In particular, Payne's characteristics are more suitable for the Nuggets. gold. In turn, we can also find reasons to be optimistic about the Nuggets, including the plateau home court advantage, a more complete lineup run-in, and the fact that their opponents may be less able to afford the effort than they are. If the Nuggets can make Monty dare not play KD and Booker, the Nuggets' advantages will be highlighted after the series is lengthened. This series is important for both sides. The Suns, who spent a huge price to get KD, certainly don't want to stand still, and the Nuggets need this series to confirm something - if the Nuggets can defeat the Suns, who are extremely restrained by the pick-and-roll, for the Nuggets with natural flaws, It would be a huge encouragement. Even if we can't win the championship, we can make some minor repairs in the future to improve the depth of the bench. There is hope for the future. But if they lose very simply - the Suns are also a team with many flaws, regardless of restraint, and their strength is not higher than that of the Nuggets - then it is indeed very worrying. Jokic's stubbornness in defending the pick-and-roll will make them ineffective. When encountering specific opponents in the playoffs, there will naturally be a debuff. No matter how good Malone is at calculating rankings, in this pick-and-roll era, it is still too difficult to completely avoid such opponents. Forward expectations: 50-50 open, 6~7 games, the Suns will have an advantage if there is no thunder in this round, and the Nuggets will have an advantage if they can seize the advantage in the connection period.

I admit that Curry is great and super giant, but I always feel that Curry is almost useless. He has almost no offensive ability with the ball. It is a team-type attack that requires the cooperation of teammates to create mismatch space and seize this opportunity to score. Not to mention Lao Zhan, he likes his character very much. In the ten years I have watched NBA, my favorite player is American ""Jay Chou"" Kyle Korver. He can be said to be the best three-point shooter in history, with a 42.9% three-point shooting rate, both in the regular season and the playoffs. With extremely stable performance, you can always trust Korver. He was the 51st overall pick in the second round of 2003, and he is also a man who can change printers. In the era of NBA talent explosion, the Platinum Era of the same year still has its own place. In my opinion, everyone around him is attracting attention, and he is like a ""little transparent"" but he has achieved the ultimate.

The reputation of being among the top three in the league in defensive efficiency is not for nothing. Except for the first game of the series, the Lakers shot pretty well, but the next four games were like shit. In addition, the Lakers can provide shooters with high-quality cover and create shooting space for shooters. James and Davis are the only ones who can fully play the role. Moreover, James and Davis have to shoulder a lot of offensive tasks and often have no time to block people. Just ""dismantle"" it. Therefore, the Lakers' shooters cannot take advantage of high-quality screens, and they do not have the bonus of moving pick-and-rolls, so the shooter's opening depends entirely on running, and the moment he runs into position (before the opponent's defense is in place), he can be discovered by the ball carrier and The pass is in place. The two core players in the starting lineup both have average three-point shooting abilities, so opponents can focus more on guarding against other shooters in the Lakers lineup. #GrizzliesvsLakers##KingsvsWarriors##nbaTucaoConference#",,,,"Grizzlies vs Lakers, Kings vs Warriors, nba complaints conference",1,3,16,4/28/23 11:24,Los Angeles Lakers Super Talk,"['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/4ab16468ly1hdf911qhrmj20xb0m7q75.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/4ab16468ly1hdf911c263j20iz0izdjy.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/ 4ab16468ly1hdf91262icj20u011iwom.jpg']",,

4.89E+15,wxv,1689247082,Puppy Football Diary,"#体育##NBA# Because Hamilton’s ability to share Yi Jianlian’s rebounds and protect the Guangdong team’s inside basket is indeed not particularly strong. The Guangdong team will indeed make personnel adjustments next season. Which big center will Hamilton be replaced by? Today's Guangdong Hongyuan team can focus on Howard, who has a super high level of rebound protection ability and comes from the China Taiwan League. In addition, there is Cousins , a big center from the NBA, who played for the Lakers in the past. Now, he can only play as a substitute in the NBA team, but his personal status is still good. Especially the ability to protect the basket is quite good. If Guangdong has to choose one of the two, I personally think that taking Cousins down and becoming a major pillar of the Guangdong team's inside line is a very good choice. . In terms of signing foreign players, in fact, the Guangdong team has a very sufficient financial bargaining chip. It can completely give a reasonable price to let these outstanding foreign players join the Guangdong team. Once the Guangdong team's inside line is strengthened, it will definitely be able to Okay, let's form a new lineup. Especially this season, Hamilton's protective effect on the inside is still not adequate. Although Hamilton's personal performance level is relatively stable and there are no particularly outstanding advantages, Hamilton will have to make personnel changes because he cannot perform at a critical level. The first is the big guard Zeng Maozhou. Zeng Maozhou is very good at 3-pointers for the Guangdong team's guards, especially his shooting percentage is super high. In the past, he was able to play at a very high three-point shooting level whether at Tsinghua University or in the domestic league. This means that Zeng Maozhou's return to the Guangdong team after recovering from a broken toe is indeed worth looking forward to. The second place is Huang Mingyi on the forward line of the Guangdong team. His personal talent is quite high. You include his height of 2.08 meters, his ability to rebound and protect the frame, and his personal abilities. The dunk ability is quite high, which is really worth looking forward to. It also includes Peng Shijun, who scored more than 31 points in a single game. The main forward's height of 2.05 meters is indeed very promising. The main center forward is Xu Xin. He was paid by the Guangdong team to go to the United States to complete special training. As his core strength has been improved, Xu Xin has actually returned in the new season, which does give people hope. Xu Xin can very well take over Yi Jianlian's role as a protector in the paint, and at the same time grab key rebounds. This is also an important responsibility for Xu Xin in the new season. The fifth person in the end, everyone is still a little familiar with him, he is Li Yingbo. He is also 2.05 meters tall and his inside impact ability is quite good, but as a young player, he still needs to be improved in the future. The five main players of the younger generation of the Guangdong team will make their debut again, which is indeed full of expectations. At the same time, including Zhao Rui, he is trying to reach a big contract of 18 million yuan. It is understood that in order to keep a very important defender, the Guangdong team will offer Zhao Rui a three-year maximum salary contract. Because Zhao Rui only received a contract of 3.3 million yuan this season, there is indeed a lot of discussion. Now that Zhao Rui is about to get a big contract of 6 million yuan, and Guangdong Hongyuan can give a contract of 18 million yuan in three years, it can be said that the Guangdong team is very optimistic about Zhao Rui, and also very much looks forward to Zhao Rui's performance in the game. In the new season, lead the Guangdong team to stand up again. At the same time, the Guangdong team actually includes players such as Xu Jie and Hu Mingxuan, and they are all affected by leg injuries and waist strains. The third guard of these three defenders has a good spirit when playing despite injuries. They are really worthy of everyone's praise and recognition. At the same time, in fact, Zhao Rui's determination to stay in the team and the introduction of the younger generation of the Guangdong team are both very exciting. If Guo Shiqiang can get greater supplements in terms of big foreign players in the new season and have better resources in terms of financial chips, in fact, Guo Shiqiang will guide the introduction of a big center at the 4th or 5th position and play in the new season. The level is definitely completely different. To put it simply, Guo Shiqiang’s local players include Chen Yingjun on the back line, Zhu Mingzhen and Cui Yongxi on the forward line, and Jiao Boqiao and Li Yanze on the big center. If we sign a 3-point shooter on the forward line next, the big center By signing an inside rim protector, the Guangzhou team actually has every chance of reaching the top four of the CBA. We know that Guo Shiqiang’s guidance is really worthy of everyone’s admiration. In general, for the fact that the Guangdong team has been able to play at such a level this season, and that Yi Jianlian can still perform so bravely at the age of 37, this is indeed worthy of our spiritual praise. The next reorganization of the competition in the new season, Du Feng and Zhu Fangyu are really looking forward to it. Now that Du Feng has also reached a contract extension with the Guangdong team, people are really looking forward to the coming seasons.",,,,"sports, NBA",0,0,0,4/26/23 6:09,Weibo weibo.com,"['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hdb14ba0qaj20nw0gs41n.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hdb14duaphj20oq0ghq60.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/ d1b82c50ly1hdb14c5rfgj20p30gqade.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hdb14aknllj20nb0fpq56.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hdb14av1 57j20nv0grmya.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg. cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hdb14b18kij20m70e4go0.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hdb14bihkrj20p70gfn0c.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hd b14b2ytrj20ov0gnjts.jpg', 'https:// wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/d1b82c50ly1hdb14b1aypj20nw0glac2.jpg']",,

Honors and achievements, especially hoping to win a championship and give myself a chance to enter the Hall of Fame after retirement. To this end, the US media listed the 16 current players with the highest probability of entering the Hall of Fame. Draymond Green is about the same as Leonard. 1-2: LeBron James Durant LeBron James has a 100% probability of entering the Hall of Fame, and Durant has a 100% probability of entering the Hall of Fame. LeBron James and Durant have already locked up their Hall of Fame spots in advance. Both have championships and are among the greatest and most talented players in NBA history. 3-4: Chris Paul, Curry. Chris Paul has a 100% probability of entering the Hall of Fame, and Curry has a 100% probability of entering the Hall of Fame. Curry has won four championships and has a bunch of three-point shooting records in his career. He will enter the Hall of Fame as the best three-point shooter in history. Although Chris Paul may not win a championship in his career, he can still enter the Hall of Fame as one of the top five point guards in history. 5-6: James Harden, Westbrook. James Harden has a 99.9% probability of entering the Hall of Fame, and Westbrook has a 99.9% probability of entering the Hall of Fame. James Harden and Durant have both won the scoring title, MVP and assist title, but they have never won a championship, but for them, they are the greatest guards in the 21st century. 7-8th place: Anthony Davis, Lillard Anthony Davis has a 98.6% probability of entering the Hall of Fame, and Lillard has a 96.4% probability of entering the Hall of Fame. There is basically no big problem with Anthony Davis being elected to the Hall of Fame. He has already won a championship for the Lakers, and he will still have a chance to win a championship in the future. As for Lillard, he doesn't seem to be qualified to enter the Hall of Fame. After all, he has never made it to the Finals, which is about the same as Paul George. 9-10: Antetokounmpo, Paul George. Antetokounmpo’s probability of entering the Hall of Fame is 93.6%, while Paul George’s probability of entering the Hall of Fame is 93.6%. Antetokounmpo has also locked up the Hall of Fame in advance, and the probability should be 100%. After all, he is already the Finals MVP, regular season MVP, and Defensive Player of the Year. Paul George is overrated. If he doesn't win a championship, his chances of being elected to the Hall of Fame are not as good as Love's. 11-12th place: Irving and Lowry have a 93.4% probability of entering the Hall of Fame, and Lowry's probability of entering the Hall of Fame is 85.7%. Irving is almost locked into the Hall of Fame. In addition to an NBA championship, he is also the most skilled and ball-savvy defender in history. Lowry's probability of being elected to the Hall of Fame is actually about the same as that of Draymond Green. After all, he has never been the boss of the team. 13-14th place: Leonard, Draymond Green Leonard’s probability of entering the Hall of Fame is 77.6%, and Draymond Green’s probability of entering the Hall of Fame is 76.8%. Leonard's probability of entering the Hall of Fame is arguably higher than that of Curry and Durant. He is a two-time Finals MVP and the Defensive Player of the Year. He is obviously underestimated here. Although Draymond Green holds four championships, many people have not been optimistic about his probability of entering the Hall of Fame. Even Draymond Green is on the same level as Leonard, which obviously belittles Leonard's status. No. 15-16: Jokic, Love. The probability of Jokic entering the Hall of Fame is 73.9%, and the probability of entering the Hall of Fame is 73.4%. Jokic has won two consecutive MVPs and is also the best center currently in service. As the leader of the Serbian national team, he can enter the Hall of Fame as the greatest international player, and the probability is 100%. Love is the former Wolf King, and his partner with LeBron James brought the first championship in team history to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The probability of being selected into the Hall of Fame is 73.4%, which is not bad.",,,,,0,0,0,4/24/23 10:56,iPhone 14 Pro,,,
4.89E+15,MDmvpfRua,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[The Bucks, the most popular team this season, are also in danger] Antetokounmpo continued to miss G3. The Heat defeated the Bucks at home, leading 2-1. G4 is still the home court of the Heat, and it is unknown whether Antetokounmpo will play. If the Bucks lose G4, they will return to their home court with a 1-3 deficit. No matter how strong their overall strength is, they will be eliminated because the fault tolerance rate of the series becomes lower. risk. I have to say that this was a situation that was difficult to predict before the series started. Of course, the Bucks have not lost G4 yet. With the ups and downs of this series, it is difficult to tell how the plot will go after that. G1 only played for 10 minutes. The Heat were accurate (60% three-point shooting rate) and the Bucks were accurate (24.4% three-point shooting rate), so the Heat stole the home court advantage in Milwaukee. The wordless deer of G2 relied on Luo Daluo to hit high balls, which mixed up the Heat paint area. He cooperated with the decisive three-point shots in various postures from the outside and scored a record 81 points in the half, which fully demonstrated his ability. The depth of this team is impressive. At this time, even if there is no letter, you will not feel that the situation is not good for the Bucks. But the situation in G3 suddenly changed, and the Heat became the leader all the way again. This kind of ups and downs is no stranger to the Heat's past series. Last year against the Celtics, the Heat also suffered a collapse and no solution. It's hard to figure out the ups and downs of their state. The difference this year is that in the past three games, the Heat's shooting touch has not been inaccurate, shooting 60%, 41.2% and 48.5% of the three-point shooting percentages respectively, and the effective shooting percentages are 68.5%, 61% and 63.1% respectively. , a high proportion of jump shots. In comparison, the Bucks have greater ups and downs, with three-point shooting percentages of 25.6%, 51% and 39.5%, effective shooting percentages of 56.7%, 66.8% and 54.2% respectively, and a high proportion of jump shots. The remaining offensive elements - turnover rate, front plate rate, free throw rate - have no obvious suppression or abnormalities. In other words, these two teams are competing for touch, outside jump shots, and floaters near the basket. Whoever is accurate wins. Although it is a comparison of accuracy, it cannot be about watching your opponent shoot, and whether or not he makes a goal depends on God's will. The Heat made an important adjustment in G3. They put Love in the starting lineup to face Lopez. This adjustment greatly reversed the unfavorable situation in G2. An important way for the Bucks to open up the defense in G2 was to focus on Luo Luo's height. The Heat's previous defensive player for Lopez was Struss, who had a huge height and weight difference and could not be defended. The Heat's overall defensive strategy is still to switch defense. After Reba came out, Daluo's basket was dominated by one pillar, receiving various alley-oops to abuse the basket, turning around and jumping hooks, completely dominating. In G3, the Bucks changed their strategy to Love vs. Luo, with Holiday/Midou and Luo playing pick-and-roll defense and delaying, and combined with other defense points to protect the basket. Others stayed in the trenches from hand to hand, enduring some of the Bucks' difficult outside ball-handling shots. The strategy achieved its goal, and Daluo was locked up. This is not Love's full value. He also did these things in this game: He came on as the Heat's substitute No. 5 in the transition period. During this period, the Bucks used Luo Luo to defend him. Love made two three-pointers in this game, and also provided space containment, which made Luo give up protecting the basket in some rounds; Love also sent precise passes to teammates who cut into the basket; Love Participated in several rounds of assisting defense, swiping cards to cause scrimmage, recovering block Holiday, destroying Luo's ball and successfully stealing, etc. Let's put it this way, Love in this game at least hedged the value of the opponent Luo. This is still not all, there is the following plot: Butler made 4 of 4 three-pointers. This person only averaged 1.6 three-pointers per game in the regular season. He has only hit 4 three-pointers in one game this season, and the rest are at most 2. The playoff version of Butler is indeed different from the regular season version; Dunro made 5 of 6 three-pointers, and even scored twice on the basket. However, this person usually does not attack the basket at all, and one of the attacks was even a single on Huo Huo. Ledi succeeded. In the regular season, Dun Luo shot 32.8% from three-point range. He had already lost the trust of the coach, but Shiro saved the world by taking out the reimbursement, completely distinguishing himself from Joha, who shot 8.3% from three-point range next door; in addition, , Lowry once again played an offensive and defensive performance close to expectations, Audi's defensive and offensive performance before injury was amazing, Struss and Martin performed steadily, and Reba also had a sense of presence in hand-offs and defense. It can be said that in the first game of G3, the Heat's full strength was online, and this was not the case in just one game. In the entire series so far, the Heat's three-point shooting percentage has been 50%. The problem that particularly troubles them in the regular season is that they are 27th in the league, 34.4%. three-point shooting percentage. In the regular season, the Heat's most accurate three-point shooter is Herro, who is currently retired, with 37.8%. Except for him, everyone's three-point shooting percentage is stuck at 35% or lower. Love has also failed in the 21 games since he came to the Heat. Only shot 29.7% of three-pointers. Now, the Heat have 8 players shooting better than 40% from three-point range. The difference in status is so big that the Heat become a different team from the regular season. There was a similar situation in the playoffs last year, but the Heat at that time had players who could usually make three-pointers, but the playoffs started to be inaccurate, and Butler, who usually didn't do everything, started to carry. But now, Butler C, and others are accurate, which is not easy. It may not be time to worry about the Bucks being unexpectedly eliminated. After all, there are two things that are uncertain: first, Alphabet is likely to come back. After Alphabet returns, the Bucks will have more flexibility in their matchups and more options; Second, the Heat's state may not be sustainable. It's possible that if the Bucks do nothing, the Heat will cool down in the next game. After all, 50% three-point shooting in the series is too unreal. There must be someone who is crazy about iron. night. The problem is that neither of these things are under the control of the Bucks. For the first place in the Eastern Conference, what they prefer is of course to control the situation rather than being determined by chance. Whether the letters will return and whether the Heat will become colder, we can only wait for the results. What Budenholzer can do is not to let Luo compete with Love in the transition period. The Bucks’ biggest advantage over the Heat is that they have higher-quality basket protection. If Luo removes this point, the Heat Not afraid of wordless deer. I have to say that the playoffs are so amazing that even the Bucks, the most popular team this season, are in danger. It's impossible not to worry about them, because this is not the first time, the opponents are the same, and even the plot is very close.

4.89E+15,MDdeqz05n,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[There is no space, no matter how good the hard solution and passing are, it cannot bring it forward] 1. The preview of Eagles VS Green Army said that if the Eagles want to cause some trouble to the Green Army, there are two key points: First, it is good to have more space. line-up. So far, the Eagles still can't quite do it. However, the G3 Hawks had some answers to the puzzle. Jaylen Johnson, who was most severely punished, scored 10 points and 4 assists on 3-of-5 shots. Although Hunter's three-pointer was still a trap, he still had two key points. Bay's value as a shooter has also been revealed; the second is to use his advantage in rushing to punish the Celtics' defense changes. In this game, the Hawks' offensive rebound rate was 37.2%, and they won some points in the second offense. But the Hawks' win cannot simply be summarized by these two key points. Young and Murray must also play well. This seems to be nonsense. If the two main players perform poorly, there is no way the Hawks can counterattack the Celtics. I want to emphasize this point because they did do something unexpected, which caused the Celtics to fail to turn the score back even if they made adjustments. In this series, the Celtics have always been in a state of ""catching fish at work"". I don't mean to disrespect either party. Kai did not show a serious face before 2 minutes and 06 seconds of the second quarter of G3. Even before Young beat Horford in a pick-and-roll at 6 minutes and 39 seconds of the fourth quarter of G3, the Celtics, who had been lagging behind, probably never thought they would lose. This is what the Green Army did in this round: the offense defeated the Eagles' defense, and there wasn't much to figure out; the defense chose to retreat instead of switching defenses, which was very effective against the Eagles in the regular season. This may be due to the changes made by watching the Heat's rebounding in the Eagles' playoff game. Or maybe he just wants to save trouble - retreating is less stressful than switching defense. If you can win by relying on offense + average defense, there is no need to overstretch the team's defense. The same thing happened when G3 came up. The Green Army scored normally. The Eagles' ball handlers, shooters, screeners, and the young people who were released all worked in various positions to score points. After beating, the Green Army found themselves Falling behind. The Green Army's advantage over the Eagles is indeed huge, but it is not an unconditional advantage in 48 minutes. After 3 games, the Green Army lost points when Lowe was on the court. There were two obvious situations: When Lowe was on the court, the Eagles' defense was obviously simplified. This was also mentioned in the preview. He allowed Capela/Okongwu to stand comfortably under the basket and protect the basket, and these two people were not given in vain. Moreover, Lowe's own defense is not without flaws. When the Green Army defends the 4/5 mismatch, he can take advantage of the rim protection by shrinking from the weak side. But his ability to defend pick-and-rolls head-on is average, and he also takes some fake moves. These problems are exposed; in addition, compared with the double pick, Yang and Murray are not lower-level developers, but the first two are in a better space environment. Here, the latter two have to face stronger defense. When both sides control the pure finishing fifth position, the double pick is not as skillful as Yang and Murray. If the Greens don't have a full-space lineup, it's really not easy for them to play against the Eagles. If the Eagles want to overthrow the Greens, in addition to making good use of Lowe's time on the court, the other thing is how to break through the Greens defense when the Greens set up a lineup with five players - unless the Greens themselves can't make a shot, the Eagles' configuration will be difficult to defend. Limiting the Green Army's five outsiders - this requires two steps: first, pick-and-roll and beat Horford, who is retreating; second, force Horford to start switching defenses, and then beat the Green Army's switching defense. At 2 minutes and 06 seconds of the second quarter of G3, the Green Army paused - Shen retreated to defend the Eagles and began to struggle. After the timeout, Horford chose to switch defense-the Hawks completed the first step. Moreover, the Hawks also broke through the defense in the next 2 minutes. However, this was also related to the Celtics' poor defense. For example, Brogdon did not swipe when Young broke through, and Smart guarded Murray with two steps outside the three-point line. If the guard is too tight and gets passed, it is better to give it a step away and so on. Entering the halftime break, Mazzula gave a speech in the locker room similar to the one given by Domoto to the Sanno players: ""We will defeat Shohoku in 3 minutes."" Then at the beginning of the second half, the Green Army's defensive intensity surged. Although Horford defended Shen retreat again, he was leading the defense. The man and the two wings contracted to help defend very fiercely. The Green Army launched a strong attack and defense and immediately evened the score difference. At 8 minutes and 13 seconds, the Eagles paused. At this time, you will feel that the Green Army is still stable. But the plot reversed after the timeout. The Green Army performed an acrobatic performance, passing the ball from the bottom corner to the bottom line audience, and lobbing the ball to the cutter to hit the backboard. On the Eagles' side, Collins responded with a three-pointer from the bottom corner, and Yang Kuai Attack and mid-range shots, super long mid-range shots, and the score widened again. In the middle of the fourth quarter, Yang hit Horford with a pick-and-roll. At 6 minutes and 39 seconds, the Green Army paused. After that, the Green Army finally pushed the intensity of switching defense and assist defense to the limit. Reality also proved that although Horford could not keep up with Yang, with the cooperation of the Green Army's assist defense, the Eagles were indeed unable to break through the Green Army's switching defense. Here is the key point for the Hawks to win - Murray made two difficult pull-up jumpers, Yang stepped back from the corner and hit Horford with a three-pointer (he cannot help defend in this position), and he broke through White's stuck floater in singles. The two men had a hard fight and the Green Army lost their temper. The Green Army failed to smoothly get 3-0 to ensure advancement like the 76ers did against the Nets. Although they don't need to panic, they still need to be vigilant - there are some differences between the Hawks and the Nets. The latter has limited development capabilities. During the critical ball stage, once the defensive intensity increases, the Nets are unable to score. But the Hawks have All-Stars. Even if Young and Murray can't make such a tough tackle every night, they still have the ability to do it again. 2. The contents of this series between the Knicks and the Cavaliers are basically consistent with the forward estimates, and G1 is the most neat: the Knicks have obvious advantages in frontcourt and rotation, and they protect the basket to the death, betting that the Cavaliers can't throw a three-pointer - and sure enough they do. If they don't score, it all depends on Mitchell's hard work to score points. Bickerstaff didn't know who to use for the last card, so he chose Osman, who made 2 three-pointers. His defense was too poor, and he was beaten by Bronson in the end. The plot of G2 was slightly reversed: the Cavaliers ordered Bronson to score, Garland performed well, LeVert was in excellent form to solve the problem of not having a qualified fifth man, and Danny Green solved the sixth man problem. This time, the Knicks couldn't make a three-pointer as a team and had some bad choices on offense and defense. The plot of G3 returned to the same pattern as G1, even a little intensified: the Knicks held the ball hard, Mitchell made many mistakes, Garland completely stretched his hips, and everyone was bullied defensively. LeVert recovered in the second half and made 0 of 6 in the first half. He and Garland combined to make 1 of 18 in the first half. This is where the hole was dug. In addition, Danny Green did not feel the game this time, so the Cavaliers did not have qualified fifth and sixth players. Without space support at all, the power of the Twin Towers cannot be exerted; although the Knicks are also very strong, they are mainly Randall. Bronson did not score a three-pointer, but the mid-range and breakthrough were solid. The Knicks played a lot of the Cavaliers' signature skills - breaking through the basket in the backcourt and constantly connecting with the center in a small space. The bench lineup continued to output, stabilizing the Cavaliers. Even Barrett has become a human being. It’s clearer now in this series. Although both teams have had extremely poor performances (Cavaliers' G3, Knicks' G2), in comparison, the Knicks are still more effortless. Thibodeau only needs to coach according to his normal thinking and employ people. , offensive and defensive strategies do not change, they can naturally poke at the Cavaliers' weak space environment, rebound protection, and connection segments. The Cavaliers can't use their brains, because the two most troublesome things for the Cavaliers - space and bench lineup - are exactly the parts that the Knicks are targeting. Regardless of Garland's unstable state, the Cavaliers cannot withstand LeVert's ups and downs. They always need one of LeVert, Okoro, and Danny Green to step up, preferably two. , ensuring that they have at least 6 rotations that are qualified. Although they were only trailing 1 to 2 in this series and the outcome was unknown, the Cavaliers still had to see that they were prevented from scoring the lowest single-game score of the season by an opponent like the Knicks who was not a strong defensive team in the regular season. , the current offensive efficiency ranks last among the 16 playoff teams, which is in sharp contrast to their regular season league 8 offense. If the space environment is too poor, no matter how good the hard solution and passing are, it will be difficult to move the ball.

4.89E+15,MDdappLVN,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Winning G3, a battle for the Warriors coaching staff to regain their face] The Warriors-Kings' G3 game was uneventful. The Warriors basically suppressed the Kings throughout the whole process, and their advantage expanded little by little. In the fourth quarter, they wereted their efforts. There are three BUFFs in this game. One is that it is played at the Warriors' home court. The other is that the space for chasing Dreams has been improved. The third is that neither the Kings' sharpshooters nor the half-assed shooters who could respond before can make three-pointers. So it seems that the Warriors have a bit of an advantage. . The experience of watching the live broadcast is that the Kings and Warriors are not very accurate, but Lunier dominates the rebounds, Curry and Wiggins score various points, and other puzzle pieces counterattack and make a few air cuts, so the game is quite easy. Since the atmosphere at Chase Center seems not to be as good as the Kings' home court, the intensity of the playoffs in this game is not even as high as G1G2. But looking back at the video, you will find that G3 is not simple. The Warriors coaching staff has something to pick up the face lost by Brown in G1G2. The G3 preview said that Cole's rotation mode can be long or short. According to past habits, it must be a long rotation. However, Cole also played a short rotation in the playoffs last year. There are variables here. Considering that the Kings have already used a three-guard lineup to close the basket, I wonder if it is possible for Cole to take a gamble and also use a three-guard lineup to confront the Kings - Cole actually did this, but However, Cole put Poole in the starting lineup, and the defense was not punished. Without Chasing Dream, G3 was actually the Warriors' best defensive game in this series. Why is this so? Even aside from the fact that G3 made fewer mistakes and was beaten less on counterattacks, G3's positional defense was the best among the three games. The Warriors were able to do this for two reasons: It’s true that the King didn’t react. The Warriors directly put Curry and Poole in the starting lineup. The Kings were not too specific about this formation, and still played more traditionally around the 5th position. Poole faced off against Murray, who rarely participated in tactics, and was almost not deliberately targeted in this game. Curry's matchup with Huerter has proven to be a disadvantage in G2, because Curry is very dependent on Sasha's cover, which will cause Huerter to hand over to obtain relatively high-quality three-point and mid-range shooting opportunities. However, Huerter can't hit the open shot, and the Kings can't take advantage of this advantage to attack fiercely, so the Warriors don't need to worry here. Monk scored only 4 points on 1 of 9 in this game. His performance in this matchup between Kuminga and Divin was indeed better than before - but that's not the point. The point is that the Warriors' rim protection has improved too much. In addition to Looney and Jaglin establishing a relatively good rim-protecting position when guarding the pick-and-roll, the key is that the recovery of the weak-side players helped a lot, which helped to block Sa's pass and rebounds. Moreover, the Warriors' weak-side recovery is not limited to the bottom corner, and the 45° side recovery is also very active. This is the second reason for the Warriors to defend well, and it is also the more important reason - it is extremely important to recover the wings to help defend. Speaking of which, this is not a special defensive arrangement, but like G3, almost every Warriors player contributed to the defense, which is very rare. For example, Tang Shen let go of Barnes' basket protection. Kuminga shrinks and cuts the ball to Savoy, Curry picks the ball from Monk, and at the end of the attack time, multiple Warriors recover the ball from Savoy and so on. This kind of universal defense game also appeared in the second round of last year's playoffs against the Grizzlies in G6. At that time, Chasing Dream's single defense 3J had too much time to take care of himself, so the assisting defense task was assigned to others, and the others also completed the task well. In addition, the Warriors also have some steals that are based on personal defense, such as DiVincenzo's multiple steals, Curry's low-post steal from Murray when retreating, Tang Shen withstanding Sapor's cutting ball while retreating, etc. . It can be said that in a game that the Warriors cannot lose, everyone's defensive awareness has awakened. Corresponding to the large number of wing defenses, the Kings were unable to respond at fixed points. Monk's suspected mentality also changed. His first two attempts at the basket were blocked by Looney and Jaglin, so he expressed his dissatisfaction to the referee, but these two Looney and Jaglin's torsos, arms and jumps were very straight. It would not be unfair for Monk to miss the whistle. He probably forgot what Mike Brown said before the game. After that, Monk was hesitant to attack the basket. On the offensive end, chasing dreams instead of playing, reduces the risk of mistakes in high-risk through balls and fast-break long passes, and greatly increases the space. These are not unexpected benefits. But that's not all. The key is that the Warriors played differently this time than before. In the first quarter, the Warriors shot 18 three-pointers and scored 6. They were not particularly accurate and did not seem to be the way to win. In G1G2, the Warriors didn't miss three-pointers because they weren't accurate enough and couldn't hurt the Kings. But I understand why the Warriors throw like this. The task given by Cole is probably to ""shoot resolutely when there is an opportunity"", because the Kings were too targeted at the Warriors' space in the first two games and contracted extremely crazily. Cole seemed to want to give the king an attitude - if you dare to let me go, I will really vote. It's impossible to win if you make inaccurate shots, so when I say Cole, it's just to give an attitude. The same goes for his rotation. It was Poole who filled the starting vacancy. In the 6 minutes of the first quarter, Cole's first rotation was DiVincenzo and Moody, and Kuminga and Lamb were ranked last. This all implies that Cole's priority in this game is The competition is space. But the real change of the Warriors is this: they gave up the POST starting style, and almost gave up some tactics of using corner screens. They adopted a large number of five-out positions and opened up a lot of space. Even when Looney is not involved in tactics, he will stand in some corners; reduce high-risk passes, do not make difficult through balls, and even reduce short pick-and-rolls where Curry directly passes the ball to Looney (the Kings may study Curry's habit of passing the ball to the center, G1G2 interception was very successful); Looney's downward threat is still limited, but he did some support and handoffs to the weak side at a 45° angle, and started again in this way. This idea runs throughout the game - the Warriors' cooperation is mainly short-range, and the Kings cannot steal; they no longer play pick-and-rolls straight in the middle, but make full use of the value of 45° players. Whether it's Curry's pick-and-roll with the center, or the pick-and-roll with the wing, or UCLA's air cut, he always looks for teammates with a 45° angle to make second passes, so as to disrupt the King's online defense and intercept the ball. The downstream player has already entered the hinterland as soon as he receives the ball, making it easier to coordinate with his teammates on cuts from the bottom corner - this wave basically defeated the Kings. In short, the Warriors play more ""safely"", more spatially, and different from the way they played in G1G2. The Warriors did not have a bad player in this game, not to mention Curry, Looney, and Wiggins. Although Tang Cha’s efficiency was low, his defense was better than usual. Tang Shen’s breakthrough was steady, and Poole provided support. Not much nonsense. In terms of rotation, Moody, Divin, and Kuminga provided visible support. Jaglin did not play badly and contributed defensively, but the coaching staff still seemed a little dissatisfied with him. After playing for a while, they still chose Kuminga. Mingjia plays a small lineup of 5. This small lineup took advantage of King Lyles's small lineup of playing 5. I don’t know if Brown will give up Lenn’s follow-up time because of this game. If he does, it may not be a bad thing for the Warriors. In addition, Curry's rotation time has also been changed, starting in 6 minutes in the first and third quarters. It's not clear what Cole's specific intention was, but Brown also squeezed Mitchell's time in the second half (Mitchell's original playing time was 6 minutes in the first and third quarters). Maybe Brown let Mitchell play later just because he didn't respond in this offense. There is also a possibility that he wanted to wait until Curry came up before playing Mitchell. Cole played Curry early, and in fact let Curry play. The time on the court with Mitchell Jr. at the same time has become shorter, which reduces Curry's consumption. For Brown, if Curry can't play, he doesn't want to play Mitchell Jr. All in all, the way the Warriors won G3 was better than what everyone thinks: ""the standard of whistleblowing"", ""the King just couldn't make a shot"", ""Looney had a lot of offensive rebounds"", ""Curry is awesome"" or ""it's just because Green didn't play"" A little more complicated. The Warriors coaching staff regained some face this time, and Cole finally led Brown by the nose. Let's see now how Brown responded in G4.

4.89E+15,MDd9U6zDM,2541959385,Ah Shun talks about the ballSean,"In 2007, Qian Chenghai, who was already a gray-haired old man and had both of his legs removed due to malignant tumors, coached Yunus. He believed that Yunus did not understand Chinese culture, the history of Chinese basketball, or the Chinese people. Mindset, basketball awareness and physicality. At that time, Director Qian pointed out that the core problem of the Chinese men's basketball team is that they cannot move and play: ""The current Chinese team has no conscious players. How did we play back then? We played with movement and breakthrough! I am training It requires players to hold the ball for no more than three seconds, pass it to their teammates within three seconds, and not stand still for more than three seconds. The current Chinese men's basketball team is all standing still."" Running and confrontation are originally the things on the basketball court. The opposite sides of. The core competitiveness of the old Chinese men's basketball team is to attack on the run, from Kuang Lubin and Guo Yonglin's double shots from the outside, to Li Yaguang (3-point shooting rate 48.4%) and Zhang Yongjun (FIBA evaluated Zhang Yongjun at the time as being the same as NBA superstar Petrovic , South Korea's Lee Chung-hee, the ""world's three top shooters"".) The two three-point shooters, and then Hu Weidong and Sun Jun who created the golden generation of history. The Chinese men's basketball team is characterized by a running-based style of play, using its accurate shooting, physical flexibility, and good skills to compete with strong European and American teams. In 2000, the rise of the three major centers gave the Chinese men's basketball team the capital to compete with world-class teams. At the Sydney Olympics, the men's basketball team defeated European champion Italy and New Zealand with Perrot Cameron, and the runner-up France that year. They lost the game until the last minute, which was also not much different from the third-place Lithuanian team that year. However, the good times did not last long. The collective aging of the golden generation caused the men's basketball team to experience two consecutive Waterloos in Indianapolis and Busan in 2002. As a result, the veterans of the 1994 golden generation collectively retired from the national team. In 2004, Harris and Yunas jointly coached The national team begins a new era. After Yunus coached the Chinese team, the so-called learning from the advanced European system was to increase the height of all positions and select the best body for each position. Liu Wei, Zhu Fangyu, and Yi Di are all the physically best players at each position. As for the core style of play, it is just one - give all the balls to Yao Ming. Since then, the Chinese men's basketball team has often had the tallest height of all participating teams, and is tallest in every position. The Chinese men's basketball team no longer relies on technology, but purely on height. The rise of the three major centers has changed the mainstream view in local education that centers only need to be trained for three years, and guards must be trained for 10 years. In order to achieve quick results, priority must be given to cultivating tall players. From this, the Chinese men's basketball team is heading directly to the point of no return. Yunus and Tu Jiao’s superstition of the so-called “advanced concepts” has kept the talent training of Chinese basketball in a pathological short-sightedness for a long time. When I hear that there is a good young talent, I first ask how tall it can grow; in Lianghe, Shandong and Northeast China, which are rich in basketball talents, the biggest goal of the most grassroots coaches is to sell their children to the prosperous Pearl River Delta professional teams and get considerable transportation fees. , and only children with absolute height can be sold at a high price; in order to achieve results and reflect their own level, the coaches of the second and third tier professional teams only focus on cultivating athletes who can rise to the top in a short period of time, almost all of whom are insiders. In Asia, the Chinese men's basketball team may still be able to rely on the height of the inside line to defeat East Asian and West Asian teams without planning players, but once the opponent has a planning inside line to compete with China's big men, the Chinese men's basketball team will face collapse - 2013 In Manila, a fiasco occurred that shook the entire society. Last year, Du Feng faced Bahrain and scored in overtime. The win was uglier than the loss. In order to learn from the so-called European ""advanced concepts"", Chinese basketball has abandoned its own traditions and the tactical concepts that are most suitable for Chinese basketball summarized by countless predecessors, ignoring technology and running and superstitious power. Jonas' level is such that he led Lithuania to a twelfth place finish at the European Championships in 2001, and two years later the same team won a historic European championship. At that time, information communication was not smooth, so he was able to call himself the ""European Caesar"" and then come to China to commit fraud. In fact, if it weren't for Wang Zhizhi, who was injured and ordered to score five consecutive points in the game against Slovenia, and Wang Shipeng's shocking shot, Yunus would have been dismissed in 2006. Without those two whistles in the 2008 game against Germany, everything in Chinese basketball will change. In the 2017 National Games, Yunus led the three Guangdong teams and lost to Xinjiang with Shi Yi and Wang Zirui on the back and Yu Changdong and Maierdan on the inside. Directly marked as the pillar of shame in history. Of course, if Yunus leaves China, he can make money elsewhere, but the bitter pill can only be digested by the Chinese themselves.

4.89E+15,MD96CxTZg,3682144042,Maple Ember in the Sky,"""I Want to Say I Love You Loudly"" and ""Until the End of the World"", when the familiar notes jump into my ears, the past will always flash back in front of my eyes like rewinding, making my throat tight. In that era before smartphones, basketball became almost all extracurricular activities in childhood and even adolescence. The promotion of NBA has pushed basketball to a new climax, and ""Slam Dunk"" based on this has become the enlightenment for countless teenagers. In early 2006, after witnessing Staples' 81-point comeback and slaying the dragon in front of that old ""big ass"" TV, the restlessness of youth was completely vented on the courts inside and outside the school. Although most of these courts are uneven, have no nets or even have sagging rims. During those tireless sophomore years, I endured the scorching heat, heavy rain, and snow, even practicing three times a day. I was scolded, complained, and even tied to a basketball net by the residents for disturbing the residents by dribbling countless times. The fractures and contusions caused by playing basketball, as well as the bleeding and pain during surgery and recovery, still frighten me even now when I think about it. But at that stupid age, with bruises and swelling on his sprained feet, and when he heard someone passing by dribbling and shaking his hand, he could still drop the dishes and grit his teeth and insist on playing until night fell and the stadium was dark. Think about it, it can be said that at that time, you had to fight even if you were looking at the shadow, and you were serious about not admitting defeat. The 2-cent ""ice pack"" and 2 pieces of soda from the canteen were paired with the cool summer night breeze, and I watched the ball go through the parabola and hit the basket. Thinking about it after the passage of time, it is the pulse of passionate blood, the heartbeat of youth, and the appearance of youth. Running, jumping, chasing and intercepting on the rough gravel ground, every frame and every second is worth remembering; making a desperate move on the lime-coated three-point line, the heartbeat seems to be suspended and condensed in time and space at that moment. Animation stopped at the national competition, and my middle school years stopped at exams and further studies. Basketball is gathering dust on bookcases, and the field court is filled with loud speakers. Fight and break through in the torrent of time, seek ""promotion"" in life, fulfill promises and assume responsibilities on the track of life. The former high school boy who was a passer-by, lost track of time after a small can of soda, and made his parents complain has disappeared. All the memories and details about ""Slam Dunk"" have been blurred by the erosion of time. The physical monster Sakuragi Hanamichi, the all-round warrior Rukawa Kaede, the sharpshooter Mitsui Hisashi, the gorilla Akagi Takenori, and the electric flint Miyagi Ryota were once complained about by their parents. The stop-motion animation where nothing can be learned seems to be frozen on the black and white drawing paper with the completion of the animation. Nowadays, animation has been brought to the big screen, and two-dimensional lines have become 3D renderings. And those infatuated people born in the 80s and 90s are no longer the same teenagers as before...",,,,,0,0,1,4/22/23 12:10,iPhone client,['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/db790f2aly1hd8cm90kzgj22c0340qv7.jpg'],,

Under Brown's training this season, the Kings' defensive accuracy and discipline are very good, especially since the lineup is mainly young people, who can run very fast at their feet. With the ball tactics being read through, the Warriors don't look that difficult to defend. The Warriors can only seize a small number of openings and fleeting defensive switches to make those shots (yes, that man). On the other hand, Rooney, who was too afraid of the Kings' shooters and struggled to get stuck, could not take care of the Monks who frequently rushed into the penalty area. This was not the first time that offensive rebounds were blown up. The 2-0 was not attributed to some people. of acting inappropriately or messing around. Green's absence allowed the Warriors to frequently play pick-and-rolls. Poor pick-and-roll defense was actually one of the reasons why Sasha never got a big contract before. As a modern center, frequently dealing with pick-and-roll positioning issues is a basic skill (especially in the Western World). ), in this game, the Warriors used fancy pick-and-rolls and simple breakthrough tactics to beat the Kings, and the Kings generals missed the mark amidst the cheers of the away team. The result can be imagined. Of course, the Kings’ inability to defend cannot be entirely blamed on Savoy. In fact, there is no one in the Kings team who is suitable to lead Curry. Fox and Mitchell can keep up without the ball, but Curry and the others decided to take the ball and fight on their own. There is really no way. Looking at it, the Kings' wing and forward defense can only be said to be okay. They work hard and try their best. It may be a bit difficult for them to help Sasha while keeping an eye on their defender. It's very difficult. It is easy to miss the Moodys who are ambushing in the bottom corner. This really looks like a breaking point. But in fact, the Fox Warriors still can't guard against it. Will the Kings' shooters continue to fight?

He is the most accurate player among centers this season in shooting three-pointers! It is worth mentioning that in the first eight seasons of his career, Lopez only made a total of 3 three-pointers. Compared with centers like Brother Big Eyebrow who can shoot three-pointers, Lopez is more like a pure center shooter.

4.89E+15,MD30h0oPI,6541985240,Hushe Laosong,"Lao Song Talks about SD (2) The Basketball Philosophy of Slam Dunk This anime is my basketball bible, and its success is based on Takehiko Inoue’s complete basketball cognitive system. I have read it many times. The more details I observe, the more I admire the author’s traditional and advanced ideas. At the same time, I have established my own view of basketball: the game will advance with the times, but many basic and fundamental things will not change easily. , many basketball concepts in it are still outdated 30 years later. The classic lies in the profoundness of its core. Among the teams portrayed by Takehiko Inoue, the one closest to real basketball is the Hainan team. It does not have the protagonist's halo and exaggerated talent of Shohoku, nor the spring and autumn style of Lingnan's description of Akira Sendō. Hainan is a dynasty team, but its strength is based on hard physical training, solid tactical literacy, a complete youth training system, and never underestimating the opponent: going all out in every game. These are the most essential qualities of basketball. thing. To a certain extent, this team based on the Lakers is more like the Spurs in temperament. Amu is a representative of Hainan style. The leader is not necessarily the one who scores the most points (Hainan has the scoring champion A Shen in the national competition), but he will start from the details of the game such as defense, organization, and even small moves using the rules. In the match against Shohoku, the first performance against Kanagawa's No. 1 player was different from Fujima's Sendō-style magic ball, but a continuous defensive judgment against Rukawa Kaede and Akagi. And after Sakuragi broke out, Amu found his weak spot and ""despicably"" went to the ground to fight against provocative emotions like chasing a dream, and even adopted shark-cutting tactics. When the situation was under control in the first half, his focus was on defense. In the second half, when the situation was unstable, he was able to score consecutive points through hard passes. This is what a truly reliable core player will do. Other players, such as A Shen, Gao Sha, and Muto, are not talented players, but they are either smart and cunning role players, or generally physical shooters who have worked hard to become good, and their functions complement each other. Just like role players in reality, they are talented. While valuable, hard work, toughness and basketball IQ are crucial. The coaching battle in the battle between Xiangbei and Hainan is also another highlight. Coach Anzai and Coach Gaotou’s constant round-to-round adjustments and counterattacks throughout the game are a bit exaggerated in comics, but overall they are very close to the adjustments of tactics and personnel in real football matches. It wasn't until Coach Anzai deployed the astonishing ""four-team-one-mark"" tactic, and 25 years later, Coach Nurse recreated this tactic against Curry in the NBA Finals that we knew it was called the box-1 tactic.

Old Place: Seven Groups of Ball Fans Green Army VS Eagles The Green Army and the Hawks finally came to Atlanta. For the Hawks, if they cannot defend this home court, the season will be over. Therefore, this game is a last-ditch battle for the Eagles, and they must use their own characteristics. Judging from the performance of the past two games, the biggest problem for the Hawks is that firstly, the defense is difficult to limit the Green Army, and secondly, the core Trae Young is in poor condition, and his role on the offensive end is not reflected at all. The good news is that after returning home, their overall offense is expected to be improved. After all, it is a team that relies on shooting and will have better shooting confidence at home. But the bad news is still that it is difficult for them to limit the Green Army's offense. The opponent's overall touch is excellent, coupled with their stable shooting ability and assault ability, it is very powerful for the Eagles' defense. Therefore, in this confrontation, the Eagles must rely on their own offense if they want to win. On the one hand, the whistle at home may be slightly advantageous, allowing the Green Army to reduce its intensity. On the other hand, it is the recovery of its own feel mentioned above. With the combined effect of these two aspects, I am still optimistic that the Eagles can have a good offensive performance. Therefore, I am optimistic that both teams will play good offense in this game, and it is recommended to score big points. Cavaliers VS Knicks The Knicks got an away game in Cleveland. This game is precious to them. After returning home, their performance is worth looking forward to - in fact, their overall offensive performance in the past two games was not stable. . The main reason is that except for the two big guys, the rest of the team has very little playoff experience. It is the first time to face such a big scene at the opponent's home court, so there will be more or less abnormalities. But they returned to their home court in this game. Several young shooters have made great progress in terms of self-confidence and experience, so we can fully expect their offensive performance. In the past two games of the Cavaliers, the two big guys broke out separately, which is also a good thing for them. After all, in the playoffs, they still have to count on the performance of their stars on the road. Mitchell and Garland have performed well in the past two games, making their performance in this game more worthy of expectations. Both teams have some good scorers, and after the young people have gone through a period of adaptation, the third game is also an opportunity for them to break out, and the Knicks' offensive ability at home this season is reassuring.

In the last year of his career, he was about to turn 39 and came off the bench. He made 116 of 309 three-pointers. It seems that age has no effect on him? Career regular season average of 19 points per game, 40% three-point percentage, and 58% true shooting percentage. He averaged 16 points per game in the playoffs during his career (due to being held back by playing as a substitute in the last three years), with a three-point percentage of 40% and a true shooting percentage of 59%. The playoffs are a little more accurate than the regular season. The peak period is very long. He was 33 years old in the 2008 finals. In 2009, when he was about to be 34 years old, he scored 51 points in a playoff game against the Bulls. In the next year's finals, the 35-year-old made 8 three-pointers in a single game, which was a finals record at the time. In 2013, a three-pointer from the bottom corner gave him and the Heat a championship. How did you do it? He is very regular, almost obsessive-compulsive - this has been written before in ""The Biography of the Big Three"": in college, his favorite thing to watch was the basketball videos of Larry Bird and Magic, two great intellectuals. His ability to run around screens, cut in, catch the ball, and shoot jump shots are all within the standard, impeccable, and can be recorded in textbooks. He only had one offensive foul all season. Calhoun, the coach of the University of Connecticut, was full of praise: ""He is independent but responsible; he is proud but humble. I always learn new things from his life... Ray Allen seems like those He is as calm as a person who never drinks coffee. No, he is like water."" He jumped 18 inches, the ball gently stayed in his right hand, his middle finger was aligned, his right arm was outlined at a perfect 45-degree angle, and his left hand protected the ball , so soft and effortless. After reaching the highest point, make a light glide with your right wrist. The ball fell straight towards the center of the net. Day after day, from every angle, he was having a dialogue with the basket, looking for a tacit understanding - the ball flew repeatedly between his hands and the basket, the arc becoming increasingly rounded, and the rotation becoming increasingly perfect. 2008, Celtics. On every game day, Ray Allen takes a nap from 11:30 to 1 p.m., eats chicken and rice at 2:30, goes to the arena to stretch and shave his head at 3:45, and goes to the court at 4:30 to practice jump shots alone. When people ask him if his shooting is God-given, Ray Allen smiles dryly. ""Don't insult God. He doesn't care if I can shoot a jump shot."" His unshakable schedule will continue even if the world ends. So occasionally he feels no need to change. Just like in Seattle he gets upset when someone takes his parking space. In the winter of 2007, Pierce performed an unprecedented 360-degree dunk during pregame warm-ups. The dunk missed, and Ray was not happy about it. ""We are on a winning streak, can we not make changes?"" After the game, the Celtics won. Ray told Pierce: ""Next time you do this move, you'd better dunk it."" That's the temper. Well, let's get down to brass tacks: Ray's unique shooting technique. Many people would say that Ray's shot is a textbook form - it's not. His shot is so unique that it's hard to imitate. In terms of hand shape, the right elbow is slightly turned out, and the shooting hands are in a triangle. When releasing the ball, release the ball when it is at the highest point and do not fully extend the hand. We all know: Old-school open shooters, including younger generation shooters such as Curry, all prefer single-action shots. The release point is not high, just lift the ball when you bend your knees. Jump ball release: This is fast and curved. The disadvantage is that it is not easy to fight against strong opponents. So new shooters also rely heavily on cover. Strong shooters such as Kobe, Tracy McGrady, and Carter are typical double-action shots. The takeoff is high, the starting point is high, and there is some air lag. The advantage is that it can take strong shots due to confrontation, but the disadvantage is that it is not easy to make arcs: so Kobe and Tracy McGrady, three-point shooters, have outstanding performances at times, but overall they are not stable. The same was true for LeBron and Wade in the early years: because they were both strong-shooting and double-action methods, they suffered from touch. The scary thing about Ray Allen is that he is a shooter who moves erratically to capture space, but he uses the double-action shooting method of a strong shooter with the ball. The arc is not too high (it gets lower in the middle and later stages of your career), it jumps to the highest point, and the shot is quick. If you can maintain accuracy in shooting, you may not be able to maintain height (Curry), and if you can maintain height and speed, you may not be able to maintain stability (Tracy McGrady). Lei, on the other hand, has height, speed, accuracy, and strong throws. Day after day of hard training, day after day of muscle memory. Why does Ray need a shooting triangle? Because this can maintain the high release point and stability of the ball, as well as the speed of the wrist swing. Why is Ray so obsessive and always maintaining that body shape? Because his entire body, including his knees, legs, waist, abdomen, shoulders, and hands, is involved in shooting, he was almost going to have problems. ""Control is all part of my life. Taking responsibility for everything and making good decisions - that's who I am."" He said in 1996. In fact, in the following ten years, he refined himself until he was infinitely close to a precision machine. Since Ray Allen was in fourth grade, his three-point shooting rate has not been lower than 37%, and his free throw rate has not been lower than 87%. Of course, his investment method is also a unique product of the times. That happened to be an era that produced strong pitchers with the ball: Kobe, Carter, and Tracy McGrady all had the ability to face the defense. Ray followed suit. But since then, shooters have had more leeway, more cover and space, and the rules have been loosened, so everyone has started to take step-back shots. There are fewer and fewer shooters like Lei who face the ball straight and make strong shots from high points. Just like Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant, and Carter, there are fewer and fewer strong shots against the defense after the three threats - now they are all called for screen shots, or they retreat significantly, there is no need to be so tired. This was also a ball of that era. The hit rate was not as high as it is now, but it seemed to be particularly exciting because the defender could hear his breathing, everyone jumped to the highest point, and the hand pressing the defender reached to the fingertips, and he went out with a whoosh. The thin line between life and death. Not necessarily the least labor-intensive way to cast. Not necessarily the most reasonable investment method.

The dilemma facing the Warriors' current starting group is still a defensive problem. On the defensive end, no one limits the performance of the pair of Fox and Sabonis. This is a problem that the Warriors currently need to solve, and the Warriors now lack Green as a dealer on the front line. , many tactics that practice makes perfect before are difficult to implement. The Warriors' Green will not be able to play tomorrow, and most of his playing time will be taken up by Payton Jr., Rooney and others.

In the first game between the Lakers and Grizzlies, on the one hand, the thick eyebrows took advantage of their rim protection and limited the Grizzlies' offense very well. On the other hand, the Lakers' three-point shooting performance was excellent. Several of their pitchers performed beyond their standards and shot more than 40%, which became the decisive factor in the game and ultimately helped the Lakers win. The two teams are facing another duel. Morant's appearance on the Grizzlies' side is questionable, but even if he is able to play, his personal status is still questionable. At the same time, another change in this game compared to the previous one is that it is not easy for the Lakers' shooters to maintain their playing status. Therefore, in such a game, the Lakers' offense will almost certainly decline. After all, they cannot be expected to maintain such production and efficiency. However, the Lakers' excellent defense will not change. The influence of thick eyebrows still exists in the interior. Morant's state also has an impact on the Grizzlies' offense. Therefore, the Grizzlies' offensive status in such a game also has a question mark. Taken together, I am not optimistic about the good offensive performance of the two teams, and it is recommended to score a small score. Heat VS Bucks In this contest between the Heat and the Bucks, the Bucks are already fighting against the odds. If they lose two consecutive games at home, few teams in NBA history have achieved a comeback. If this battle continues, Hiero will definitely be absent from the Heat, but Antetokounmpo's prospects from the Bucks are questionable. There was news before the game that he was unlikely to play, but coach Budenholzer was optimistic that he could play. Overall, judging from Antetokounmpo's body and fighting spirit, as well as the nature of the playoff smoke bomb, etc., we are still optimistic that Antetokounmpo can come back. From a strength comparison point of view, the Bucks far surpass the Heat in terms of overall strength and depth. Due to Hiero's absence, the Heat currently lack stable scoring points, and Lowry's physical health is also worrying. Stimulated by the Bucks' first defeat, this game is worth looking forward to in terms of desire to win and intensity.

Although the Nets led by 5 points at the end of the first half, they were severely guarded by their opponents in the 3rd quarter, and the gap was widened to double digits in the final quarter. The 76ers ended the game Winning 96-86, achieving 2 wins and 0 losses in the series. This is the 6th consecutive game that the Nets have lost to the 76ers in the playoffs. The next two games will be played in New York, the Nets' home court. The Nets' shooting percentage was as low as 37.5%.

James Harden only scored 8 points on 3 of 13 shots. In the final quarter, the Nets tried their best to catch up, but could not catch up with just one step. Harden hit a step-back three-pointer with more than 9 minutes left, allowing the two teams to gradually widen the gap.

Their success rate in positional battles is much higher than that of the Nets. So even if the Nets' defensive end caused enough trouble for the 76ers, allowing Harden Embiid to score a total of 24 shots, 28 points, and 13 turnovers, his offense was still not enough. In the end, the Nets' effective field goal percentage dropped below 46%, and they had no advantage in free throws. They were bombed with 13 offensive rebounds and scored 0-18 in the second attack! In addition to making 19 turnovers, the 76ers took advantage of the mistakes and scored 22 points. They were unbeatable in every aspect.

Ohashi is an All-Star, but what he is currently playing is the efficient finishing basketball of an excellent team's second best. . Dinwiddie is a 2.5-level engine. When he faces Niang, Maxey, and Harden and cannot quickly separate or pass and then score suddenly, the Nets can only rely heavily on rushing to change the rhythm. As well as relying on the shooter himself to create fleeting opportunities. Vaughan has made a very proactive opening strategy for two consecutive games, but it turns out that in the face of the huge gap in strength, one way to the end is no longer enough. The Nets need to continue to take risks. Do you dare to use two completely different strategies in the first and second halves? Do you dare to take the risk of being defeated directly in half a quarter and go to Sumner or Little Train in the middle of the third quarter? Do you dare to make the way to defend Embiid more complicated, or even accept the possibility of causing chaos?

The reason for the loss was the inability of the backcourt defense to match up with others. When Fox and Monk burst into the edge of the paint area, Rooney had to choose one of the two bottles of poison. Either bet that Fox won't score from the mid-range, or delay the move, but at this time, the inside line is empty, and the Kings will hit the reasonable collision area through one or two passes of the ball, and either they will be fouled or they will score, including The shooter comes out of the double pass, and Huerter, Barnes and Keegan-Murray combined to make one of 11 shots today. The Warriors will definitely make adjustments to see if Cole will let his brother face Forbes for the whole game, but then Barnes will have to be handed over to Thompson. Klay's offense is still the same Klay, but Klay's defensive ability has improved after a serious injury. He is no longer the Klay who can defend the No. 1 and No. 2 attackers on the opposite side. It depends on whether Cole will increase Kuminga's playing time in the next game. Although he has little experience, his mobile uniform can match the Kings' backcourt.

4.89E+15,MCbDtgIme,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"In the first playoff game of 2023, the Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Brooklyn Nets without any surprises but with ups and downs of emotions. There is a paragraph in Gu Long's ""The Sentimental Swordsman and the Ruthless Sword"": Guo Songyang and Jing Wuming had a sword fight, and they were destined to die. The flaw was exposed, so Jing Wuming stabbed him more than twenty times, so that Li Xunhuan could read out the sword marks on his body. Jing Wuming’s swordsmanship. Today's Brooklyn Net is probably comparable to Guo Songyang: They adopted an unconventional approach and exposed numerous flaws. ""I know I can't win, but try this. How will Philadelphia feel? - You can also see from the scars on my body."" , you can see the swordsmanship of Philadelphia."" The net's approach is: to flank the scoring champion Embiid from beginning to end. The reason why I say it is unconventional is because Philadelphia's three-point rate in the regular season was 39%, ranking first in the NBA. To flank Embiid is to ask Philadelphia's shooters to kill themselves. A normal team will find a balance between flanking Embiid and interfering with the three-point group. The Net said there is no need to balance: just flank, how about it! Come on, come on, surrender to me! . As a result, Philadelphia made a team-record 21 three-pointers in the game and grabbed 14 offensive rebounds. But the process was fun. The first goal at the net was a switch of defense + active double attack to deal with Embiid, forcing him into a blind corner and falling to the ground. Embiid made 1 of 4 shots in the first 9 minutes. The only offensive highlight of the Nets is Bridges. The kid who was born in Philadelphia, the kid who was drafted by Philadelphia and then sent away, scored 23 points in the first half today. Philadelphia's three-point line + penalty area defense is more than enough to deal with Dinwiddie, but it can't stop Bridges from showing off his power in the mid-range: - After all, he is, according to his own words, learned from Booker and Paul in the Suns, and A child who has loved Maddie since childhood. Coach Rivers began to make adjustments. In the middle of the first quarter, he arranged for Embiid to extend to the three-point line; in the last 4 minutes of the first half, Embiid even went to the three-point line to defend Bridges - able to force out Philadelphia's defense changed, and Bridges really played well. Of course, Bridges' bravery was not enough to win the game, but he allowed the Nets to catch up with Philadelphia in the first half; so we can see how the Philadelphia generals reacted to the Nets' mentality defense method: - —Maxi was a little impatient and missed a two-point shot; he was too anxious to slow down two layups and missed; he missed a throw. ——Harris was once used by coach Rivers as Ray Allen and Redick, and he felt awkward for a while. ——Tucker does all the right things diligently, but he doesn't always make open shots. ——Embid struggled with Claxton every time he entered the frontcourt, knowing that he would be flanked as soon as he got the ball, and he looked unhappy. The only one in Philadelphia who seems to be feeling calm is Harden. At the beginning of the second quarter, Harden sent three assists in a row to stop the net, and then assisted Niang for one; however, Niang was restless, eager to try more than once, and then missed. Every time Harden tries to run a tactic and Niang tries to surprise, the result is often: Harden's father: Listen to me, just do it... Niang: No, I have grown up, I want to try my own—— (Comes back in disgrace) I'll give you the ball, dad, what should we do? Harden's father looked at him with a gentle and caring expression: ""You gave the ball back to me, but there are only 7 seconds left in 24 seconds!"" In the second quarter, Philadelphia once hoped to solve the game early: Harden continued Three three-pointers opened the score, but Bridges bravely chased the score back to single digits. The net shot 62% in the first half and Philadelphia shot 45%, but Philadelphia led by 9 points - basically from three-pointers and offensive rebounds. Embiid was flanked in the first half and scored 10 points on 3-of-7 shooting. Harden made 4 of 5 three-pointers, but 1 of 8 two-pointers - three blocks. The situation is clear: Embiid can play, but the net won't let him. Harden knows how to play and can make three-pointers by stepping back, but his explosiveness makes it difficult to finish efficiently. In the third quarter, Embiid played with fire. He knew that the net would still flank him, so as soon as he caught the ball, he turned back and attacked, making a 2+1, and then made a mistake. At 7 and a half minutes in the third quarter, Embiid vented his anger on Philadelphia's offensive rebound and dunked, but was directly fouled by DFS and fell unconscious for a moment. After that, Embiid missed a strong shot and was hit by Dinwiddie instead, narrowing the point difference to 7 points. Harden found Harris who was counterattacking first, and then lobbed a ball to Embiid to appease him. In the fourth quarter, Embiid hit a jumper from the free throw line to give Philadelphia a 103-89 lead. During the timeout, he was still angry. In the next round, he was sentenced to a foul on Bridges and yelled at the referee angrily. In fact, the game was over at that time, and the nets were replacing substitutes. But for Embiid: After being flanked for a whole game, his displeasure was written on his face. So here it is: The Nets double-teamed Embiid at all costs, allowing him to score 26 points on 7-of-15 shooting, allowing Philadelphia to get 14 offensive rebounds and 21 three-pointers. Tactically, this flanking attack was not a success, but it was clear during the process: - Maxi could easily lose his rhythm when engaging in psychological defense. ——When Embiid is unhappy with being flanked, he will get emotional, get angry after being forced to handle flanking passes again and again, and will attack once or twice when it is obvious that his teammates are open. ""I really thought that I could defend against flanking."" Me?"" - As mentioned above, the only player in Philadelphia who is always online, knows the situation on the court, and can exploit the opponent's weaknesses is Harden. Today he had 23 points, 13 assists, and a team-high +20. Of the 21 three-pointers Philadelphia made, he assisted 5 and made 7 himself. But today he made 1 of 8 two-pointers and had three blocks. Before the end of the first half, the Nets made their last attack. Harden directed his teammates to defend and suddenly participated in the offensive attack on the line, destroying the Nets' offensive intentions. In the fourth quarter, Harden counterattacked and missed a three-pointer. When returning to defense, he couldn't lower his waist at all; in the next round, he cleverly assisted Reed, and then got excited on the sidelines: that was the only time he showed his emotions in the whole game. In these rounds, it is especially clear: in terms of overall awareness and emotional control, he is the most reliable commander in Philadelphia; when encountering unconventional defense methods such as the net, Embiid will be unhappy, and Maxi will help Unstable, Harden can calmly and calmly find the openings of his teammates, find the rhythm of the whole game, and find the most reasonable routine at any time. He also teaches the net how to correctly lob pass (today the net's lob pass seems to be related to the rebound). Qiu) - He is smart, he is precise, and he adapts to circumstances, but when he needs to exert more force, his legs and feet may not be able to support his ideas. This is the lesson the Net learned today: If a team tries to beat Philadelphia this season, Embiid's emotional ups and downs, Maxey's rhythm control and Harden's explosive legs and feet can make a fuss - although this task, the Net It's quite difficult to complete.",,,,,13,27,168,4/16/23 4:46,Weibo web version,['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hd122obrtej30xc0m8gov.jpg'],,
4.89E+15,MC8Wv0JoK,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[There will be no Black Eight 2. Bucks VS Heat] Everyone knows that the Heat have no hope of winning this series. The plot also seemed familiar. After a good season, the Heat lost their starting power forward, their shooters collectively failed, and handed over a sluggish offensive season. Then they met the Bucks in the first round... it was a loss. awful. The first thing the Heat have to figure out is how to set up the starting lineup. Reba is the most suitable candidate to match the letters, but if Reba matches the letters, who will match Da Luo? If the Heat put together a small lineup for the play-offs - Herro, Vincent, Strus, Butler, Reba - they wouldn't be able to use Reba to face letters, they can only use Reba to face Los Angeles and Butler to face him. letter. Although Butler can withstand pressure and can shoulder heavy responsibilities, his size difference is huge and the team's defense requirements will be higher. Do the Heat dare to put Love into the starting lineup against Los Angeles? The Bucks are not a military training team, Love has tonnage and rebounds. I'm not sure this is feasible, but if there is any series where the Heat hope Love will play his ideal role most, it should be this round; another compromise option for the Heat is to start Martin, but this usage seems The problems on both sides of the offense and defense cannot be solved, because Martin cannot match Antetokounmpo and Da Luo, and it is unlikely that he will explode with a three-pointer. However, this adds a candidate who can match Holiday and Middleton. Other more imaginative uses, such as using Lowry to deal with big men, are outside the scope of discussion. All in all, the Heat's starting lineup is awkward enough. But relying on integrity, the Heat still hope to maintain a relatively decent defensive data, which they have proven in the past. The Bucks play a straight-forward style and will not drag the Heat's defense outside. The most likely way for them to defeat the Heat is a three-pointer instead of directly crushing the Heat basket. In other words, the Heat may be able to maintain their defensive base. . The problem is still that the Heat are almost helpless at the other end of the court. In the 2020 playoffs, the Heat's attack on the Bucks' defense was due to a combination of factors: Crowder at position 4 hit a three-pointer and responded with an empty letter; Dragic/Reba played a high-level pick-and-roll in the middle, punishing Los Angeles. ; The Heat had super-high-level three-point shooters at that time, as well as space-based insiders like Olynyk; Butler made a name for himself in several games; the Bucks had problems in terms of staffing and employment. Where can the Heat stack these buffs now? Unless Lowry and Love return to their peak, the Heat really won't be able to produce the same configuration they have had for 20 years, and the Bucks' defensive configuration has been upgraded compared to that time. If the Heat want to break through the Bucks' defense, they need Herro to hand over a value that matches his new contract, Struss to show his level in the second game of the play-offs, and Lowry to show his form in the first game of the play-offs. Butler was hard from the beginning to the end, and Reba was able to transform into Michelle. This is not true. Go for a standing and walking series. The likely outcome: The Heat lose. Heat fans are demanding trades for Herro and Adebayo. Passers-by fans said, why ""everyone brags about Butler when he wins, but no one criticizes when he loses""; the Bucks lost.

4.89E+15,MC7rCeom4,2541959385,Ah Shun talks about the ballSean,"The 76ers have about five defensive weaknesses in the regular season: 1. The entire team is small, and only Embiid in the rotation has the ability to protect the frame in the paint. ——Afraid of teams that can attack the frame violently and rush for offensive rebounds. 2. Embiid's offensive load is too heavy, and because the 76ers do not have a qualified second rim protector, Embiid basically does not frequently expand the defense zone most of the time, focusing on squatting. At the same time, the 76ers are the main force. Most of the players in the lineup generally have poor ability to cover. ——Afraid of teams that are strong in holding the ball and shooting. 3. The team has many players with slow lateral movement and slow movement speed (Niang, Harden, Harris, Tucker), and their ability to defend off-ball tactics is average. ——A strong team that is afraid of fixed-point breakthroughs and off-ball tactics. 4. Because players are generally slow and have slow legs and feet, their defense is poor. ——Afraid of making mistakes and pushing teams with strong fast break ability. 5. Maxi. --Afraid of top offensive backfields. The second and fifth items can basically be summed up in one point - fear of the top ball-handler in the backcourt. The first and fourth items can basically be summed up in one point - they are afraid of a team whose physical quality is much stronger than theirs. The 76ers' defensive efficiency ranks eighth in the league during the regular season, and is considered average among playoff teams. Although they have many defensive problems, it is still difficult to completely defeat the 76ers' defense. Physical talent, top backcourt developer and top spacing, at least two of the three are required to beat the 76ers' defense. So when we come to the Nets, all they can achieve in these three areas is high-quality space. They do not have a top backcourt developer, and they do not have better physical conditions than the 76ers. It is actually not difficult for the 76ers to defend the Nets' offense. The Nets also lack shooters inside, and neither Zhao Si nor Sharp have shooting range, so Embiid can squat under the basket very well. As for the Nets' defense, the Nets' defensive strength is on the wings rather than the inside, and the core of guarding the 76ers is to be able to limit Embiid. If Embiid can kill easily, the Nets have no chance. If the Nets want to defend the 76ers, I think they may use a lot of zone defense and double-team Embiid's strategy, because Embiid has too great an advantage. As long as the 76ers don't take Tucker, they have the capital to place a large number of shooters around Embiid. As long as the degree of control is not too outrageous, the Nets basically have no chance. #NBAPlayoffs##Nets vs. 76ers#",,,,"NBA playoffs, Nets vs 76ers",1,7,22,4/15/23 18:06,Weibo web version,,,

4.89E+15,MC6sbwT5M,5972505998,Big-Baller,"Congratulations to the brothers who followed yesterday for winning all two games. I hope to win all three NBA games today. The private dishes in the old place are still popular among fans. Seven groups of Eagles VS Green Army. The Eagles escaped through the play-offs and came to the Green Army. before. Judging from the past few seasons, teams that have completed the play-offs are generally able to enter the playoffs earlier. After all, their opponents are waiting without a game, but they can experience the playoffs early. strength. Overall, the Eagles still have strong offensive and defensive attributes. They mainly rely on their own offense. If they want to win against the Green Army or cause some trouble to their opponents, they still have to play their own offense well. The Green Army's home offense this season is very good. They have stable three-point shooting and deep rotation depth. With these two points superimposed, against the Eagles' weak perimeter defense, there is still a very good chance of scoring high at home. As mentioned above, the Hawks' current state and intensity may be more suitable for the playoffs, but this adaptation does not mean that they can perform well on the defensive end. After all, in terms of defensive resources at positions 3-4, they It is difficult to match the Green Army. But after experiencing the game against the Heat, their performance on the offensive end is expected to continue to be stable. The visiting team Eagles are typically strong in offense and weak in defense, while the home team's Green Army is very stable on the offensive end. The defensive intensity may need to be improved gradually as the series progresses. In addition, both teams have excellent rotation depth and substitutes. The person in charge of the game is still optimistic that the two teams can play a good offensive performance in this game, and recommends a big score. Knicks VS Cavaliers This contest between the Knicks and the Cavaliers can be said to be the most suspenseful encounter in the Eastern Conference in the entire playoffs. The Cavaliers don't have much playoff experience, but Mitchell, the eldest brother, is a frequent visitor to the playoffs. The Knicks' Randall and Brunson also have some playoff experience, but the more difficult point for the Knicks is that Randall has just recovered from a serious injury and doesn't know his condition. The performance of both teams on the defensive end is worth looking forward to. One team has a famous defensive coach like Thibodeau, and the other team once played the top defense in the league, with excellent defensive resources at positions 1-5. . However, both teams also have some problems on the offensive end - Mitchell has never been an efficient scorer on the Cavaliers' side. The team's offensive rhythm is not fast and the offensive development is limited. The Knicks have more young shooters. When it comes to the playoffs, in the first game, it may be difficult for them to smoothly transition from the regular season to the playoffs. In addition, the Cavaliers' defensive end they face here Very strong, so the Knicks' offense is also not worth looking forward to. Both teams are teams whose overall offensive stability is not strong enough and the rhythm is not fast. In addition to the intensity bonus in the playoffs, this game is not optimistic about the two teams being able to maintain high efficiency for a long time and quickly enter the game rhythm. Recommended Score a small score. Warriors VS Kings This contest between the Warriors and the Kings is very familiar to each other. Needless to say, the relationship between Cole and Bread. Players like Barnes on the Kings side are also old heroes of the Warriors. However, this game is a big challenge for the Kings. After returning to the playoffs, the players in their lineup are very inexperienced in the playoffs and are full of young people like Murray and Mitchell. Therefore, they In the first game, you will definitely have to pay some tuition due to lack of experience. The Warriors' away defense this season has been lackluster. The main reason is that this team is at a physical disadvantage and can only make up for its shortcomings by increasing its intensity. However, in the regular season on the road, they are often trapped by the whistle and unable to increase the intensity. But it's different in the playoffs. The defensive performance of Wiggins and Payton Jr. in this game is noteworthy. From the above analysis, we can see that the Warriors' defense and the Kings' offense point to the fact that it will not be easy for the Kings to reproduce the regular season offense in this game. Then the only doubtful point is the Warriors' own offense. On the one hand, the team is still in the running-in stage, and Wiggins' status after returning is questionable. On the other hand, after the team put in a lot of energy on the defensive end, it is difficult to maintain efficiency on the offensive end. Therefore, in this game, the Warriors are not optimistic about the sustained and stable output on the offensive end. It is recommended to play small points in this game.",,,,,0,11,15,4/15/23 15:34,Weibo web version,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/006wc1DUgy1hd0f6ual66j30fy0n37b0.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/006wc1DUgy1hd0fe6zlj1j30g00r3tf3.jpg']",,

He played a high-quality starting level in his rookie year, and his influence is beyond the next three blocks. Second to fourth are Jaylen Williams, Benqueiro and Murray. ② Banqueiro is really not good at magic balls, but his production has increased, and he has maintained his efficiency by relying on the aggressiveness of unexpected explosions. It's okay by rookie standards, but he needs to improve next year. ③Murray's position in the NBA has turned into a pure fixed-point shooter, and he made a qualified rotation contribution in the first year, which is unexpected but good. ④ Smith's and Maturin's shooting did not meet expectations at all. Smith's efficiency was extremely poor, and Maturin's output was very low. ⑤The most popular high-position pick should be Johnny Davis. The Spurs' Wesley and Branham are also two big black holes.

4.89E+15,MBH0ynUjN,2374464813,Mr. Di loves sports,"Brothers, there is a crucial match in this round of Serie A about to be played at 02:45 in the morning on April 15th. You must not miss it. The two teams in this game are Spezia and Lazio. In this game, both teams need to score three points to ensure that they can achieve their goals in the league. Due to the importance of this game, there is a high probability that both sides will not open up their postures to fight against each other. Stable defense is the top priority. This game is likely to be a small victory with one goal. Originally, before this, Serie A's relegation situation was relatively clear. Since the strength of Sampdoria and Cremona this season is really poor, these two teams have already contacted the printing factory to print tickets for Serie B love next season, and Verona Due to the loss of many main players in the past two seasons, the team's strength has declined very quickly, and it has almost stayed firmly in the relegation zone. However, since Spezia's upset victory over Inter Milan, the team has suffered many rounds without a win. Currently, the team has fallen to the fourth position from the bottom, only four points higher than Verona. This has made Verona. Rona has rekindled its fighting spirit to avoid relegation. Thinking about it, after Spezia defeated Inter Milan, they were almost ten points above the relegation zone. It seems that these small clubs really can't get too carried away sometimes. I guess the victory over Inter Milan made the Spezia team feel that the difficulty of the league this season is just that. , the players all thought about where to go on vacation after the holidays, but reality slapped themselves hard. Lazio has achieved great success this season. Although the team did not have an explosive performance like Naples, the team is too stable. Although Lazio's performance at the beginning of the league can only be described as mediocre, after a brief downturn in the early stages of the league, Lazio began its dream journey this season. In fact, Lazio has not made any major signings in the past few seasons. The basic main framework of the team is still the veterans of these seasons. Immobile, Alberto, Anderson, Milinkovic and others are all Lazio players. The meritorious players in the past few seasons, but by using these veterans as the main framework and adding some immediate combat capabilities, Lazio's results this season have achieved qualitative improvement. First of all, the team's veterans have changed their careers. As the team's captain and core, Immobile continues to perform in double figures in the league. Although his speed and explosive power can no longer be compared with those of his youth, Immobile relies on With his rich experience and excellent ability to grab points, he is still the team's well-deserved offensive core. Veterans such as Anderson and Albert have also experienced explosive growth this season. Their scoring data may not be so eye-catching, but they have done very well both in terms of the team's offensive organization and defense. . This season, Lazio spent 7.1 million euros to introduce Italian international Zacagni, who has also fulfilled the expectations given by the team. Zacagni is currently the team's top scorer in the league. He is only 27 years old this year. years, there will be broader development in the future. For Spezia in this game, if they can continue to score points at home, then they can be one step closer to relegation. For Lazio's goal of the Champions League, it is their own responsibility to get three points in every game. The only goal.

4.89E+15,MBx0V9S9x,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[76ers vs. Nets, are they stable? 】The 76ers played against the Nets 4 times in the regular season, and the 76ers won them all. However, 2 of the 4 games took place before Durant's big trade, and 1 was the final off-season battle. The only ones with real reference value are the three battles between the two sides. This was Bridges' first game with the Nets. The two sides fought to the last minute, and the 76ers won 101-98. This game is very typical. Friends who care about these two teams can go and watch the game on February 12th. Let me start with the following three points: First, the Nets after the big trade are not strong enough and there is a clear gap with the 76ers. Since Bridges came to Brooklyn, the Nets have a record of 12 wins and 15 losses, losing 2 points per 100 possessions, ranking 23rd in offense and 17th in defense during the same period. If you play at this level for a season, you won't be ranked sixth in the Eastern Conference. The Nets have a good record before the big trade. There is no need to deny this; secondly, in terms of style, the Nets have limited room to restrain the 76ers. Although the Nets can put up a five-out lineup, they neither have the first main attack point capable of tearing apart the defense nor the ability to score multiple points. They may not be able to let the 76ers rotate to lose sight of one thing. After the big trade, the Nets ranked 26th in basket shot frequency, 27th in basket field goal percentage, and 21st in three-point field goal percentage during the same period. It can be said that they are not strong enough inside and outside. The main advantage is long two-pointers. After coming to the Nets, Ohashi's mid-range shooting rate is as high as 48%. He can hit the 76ers, but it is not enough to kill them. We’ll talk about this later; third, conversely, Embiid, the 76ers’ strongest point, happens to be the Nets’ weakness in matchups. The Nets have all the resources to defend positions 1 to 4, and there is no pressure to defend the light position 5, but they cannot deal with heavy centers. Although the only reference game between the two teams this season was a 50-50 draw, the 76ers still had an advantage over the Nets. The fundamental gap was that the 76ers had a point that the Nets needed to work hard to deal with. In turn, the Nets There are no players who can fully change the 76ers' defense, so the fault tolerance rates of both sides are not at the same level. If the Nets want to win, they have to answer more questions and perform better, while the 76ers only need to advance according to the normal plot. But - yes, there are still buts - the Nets do have a way to beat the 76ers. The specifics are as follows: switch defenses to break Harden Embiid's pick-and-roll, and try to control Embiid's receiving position away from the basket. Position, when Embiid started dribbling, he immediately flanked him, relying on the rotation advantage of all players to outperform the 76ers in transferring the ball. The 76ers have poor offensive rebounds, and the main means of responding to the Nets' attack are fixed-point three-pointers and subsequent breakthroughs, which the Nets can relatively handle; they rely on Bridges' mid-range ability to defeat Embiid. Dinwiddie exploits some individual defense weaknesses. The starting style increases the shooter's movement, and the 76ers may not be able to defend every off-ball point. If these things can be done on both ends of the offense and defense, the Nets can gain an advantage for a period of time, which is also the key to their victory. But these approaches are not easy to maintain. There are two questions here: First, can the Nets play the ultimate double-team defense + counterattack that lasts throughout the game? It is true that the Nets have many people who can play, but not many people who can defend, especially against Embiid. In previous games against Embiid, the fourth brother has often performed better than expected on the defensive end, but I don't believe he can really handle Embiid one-on-one in the playoffs. The Nets are likely to start flanking from the first minute and enter a rapid rotation mode, which will consume a lot of physical energy on the defensive end. The backup center behind the fourth brother is Sharp. His performance in the latter part of the season is better than that in the early season. It is still doubtful whether he can do much in the playoffs. In terms of forward, the Nets are well-managed, with Bridges, Fan, Johnson, and O'Neal. However, due to the lack of manpower inside, the forward rotation must support the inside rotation. Putting five outsiders at the 5th position on top of the electric fan is also a method that should be tried against the 76ers. Calculated this way, the forward manpower is only enough. Looking at the backcourt, there is a group of players who play poor defense. Except for Dinwiddie who is bound to start, the Nets' other backcourt rotation times are unstable. Joe Harris will have time, Curry is hard to say, and Mills will have to wait a little further. Thomas, as a sharp-edged swordsman who is unbalanced in offense and defense and is unstable, may be miraculous in some games, but not suitable for playing in some games. These guards who can help on the offensive end are each worse than the other on the defensive end and cannot be used as puzzle pieces in a flanking defensive system. The Nets and Raptors are different - the Nets are a relatively small forward team, while the Raptors are a forward team with almost all members at the fourth position. The latter has better resources to defend the 76ers and has obvious counterattack capabilities. Better than the Nets. In order to support the high-consumption defense, Vaughan can try to use Watanabe and Sumner who have fallen out of the regular rotation. They are the Nets' most energetic players, and vitality is the Nets' greatest advantage over the 76ers. Second, what kind of offense can Dinwiddie and Bridges produce under the intensity of the playoffs? Dinwiddie averaged 9.2 assists per game after coming to the Nets, but his possession rate was only 21.8% and his true shooting percentage was 51.9%. Personal ability to absorb the ball is really limited. If Embiid keeps retreating, Dinwiddie may not be able to play. Bridges averaged 26.1 points per game and had a true shooting percentage of 60.7%, but he has not yet been able to break through the trap. If he switches too many times without the ball in order to avoid the trap, it will aggravate the problem of the Nets' development difficulty. At the extreme end, Embiid and Tucker can switch defenses directly, and neither Bridges nor the fourth brother may be able to punish the mismatches they catch. Will placing a five-out lineup help Dinwiddie and Bridges make the offense easier? I am not sure. If Dinwiddie is replaced by Doncic, the Nets' five-way lineup will definitely be impossible for the 76ers to guard. But if you tell me about Dinwiddie or Bridges, picking and rolling with electric fans, and knocking out Embiid for several games with one outside roll, this scene is still too magical. The key here is that the five-out lineup must have a one-on-one strong point that can cut down trees. You can name the opponent's non-top defenders at will, so that shooters can get relatively simple shooting opportunities. But the Nets version of the five outsiders cannot do this, and the requirements for 3D players such as Electric Fan and O'Neal will be significantly increased, and the shooting performance of these two people after the big trade is not good enough. However, so far, the Nets' five-man team of Dinwiddie + O'Neal + Bridges + Johnson + Electric Fan has taken 106 rounds and defeated their opponents by 22.9 points per 100 rounds, which is quite explosive. If this lineup really works for the 76ers in the playoffs, it may become an X factor in the series. In addition, the Nets also have an X factor-their transition period is more unpredictable. We have all the advantages and disadvantages of the 76ers' uncensored lineup and the uncensored lineup, and the changes will not be too big. After Simmons was injured, the Nets bench's off-ball style of play with him as the pivot no longer exists. How Vaughn uses people is even more variable. Except for Harris and O'Neal, it is difficult to predict how other points will be deployed. It is a conservative choice to remove Dinwiddie and Bridge and lead the team separately with substitutes, so that the starters will spend less time together against Embiid. Does Vaughn dare to put together a lineup with more shooters and a more aggressive offense? If Thomas and Curry are put together, Harden will probably be liberated, and he may not be able to beat the transition period. There's no perfect answer, it just depends on what Vaughn wants. All in all, as long as they don't make any mistakes, this is a series in which the 76ers have a great advantage. If the Nets want to win, they need to execute their winning plan perfectly and do it at least 4 times. This is indeed not easy. The possible outcome is: the Nets lost as expected, and the Nets fans are emotionally stable. They all said that they have made a profit this season and have a bright future. No Nets players entered the meeting room because passersby fans were watching Embiid, Harden, Durant, and Irving; if the 76ers unexpectedly lost, there is a high probability that Rivers would surprise everyone and Embiid would make a mistake. There was an explosion, Harden scored constipated, Maxi was beaten, Harris was inexplicable, and Towers scored 10 points in 7 games. After the game, passers-by fans laughed at Embiid's MVP status, and everyone recalled the story of ""Yo"". 76ers fans fought hard and demanded that Maxey and Harris be traded. Brother Deng left the team and the emperor asked for a trade. The process is over and I no longer believe it.

4.89E+15,MBujtExyk,6157528857,Brother Liao talks about sports and football,"Showdown between the 76ers and the Nets: How the Nets found the 76ers' weaknesses! Ever since Harden and Simmons swapped teams 14 months ago, we have always looked forward to the playoff showdown between the 76ers and Nets. Now this matchup is about to come true. Unfortunately, this matchup does not include Simmons (reimbursed due to back injury), nor Durant and Irving (who, like Harden, asked to be traded and left Brooklyn). There is no doubt that Embiid is the best player in this series. Harden will face his old team, but he will face a group of new faces who have only joined since he left. The new Nets achieved a record of 13 wins and 15 losses after the trade deadline, entering the playoffs ranked sixth in the Eastern Conference. The top six players in the Nets are all masters of defense and switching. After Bridges joined the Nets, he averaged 27.4 points in the first 23 games (he only played 4 seconds on Monday). But the 76ers are on another level. They have both offense and defense and are one of the three teams in the league's top ten on both offense and defense. They have one of the best players in the league, who is having the best year of his career, and he's surrounded by the league's top three-point shooters. Regular season record: November 23: 76ers 115-106 Nets January 26: 76ers 137-133 Nets February 12: 76ers 101-98 Nets April 10: 76ers 134- 105 Three things the Nets need to pay attention to: 1. How do the Nets restrict Embiid? Claxton has enough size to disrupt Embiid to an extent, but it's clearly a tough matchup for the Nets. When Harden and Embiid initiated the pick-and-roll, the Nets adopted a defensive switching tactic. The league MVP candidate made 12 of 18 shots against the small man after the switch, and scored 37 points on 12 of 13 from the free throw line. But this was not the most efficient part of the 76ers' game. The Nets led by 9 points in the fourth quarter but only managed 1 of their last 12 offensive attempts. 2. Can the Nets find the 76ers' weaknesses? The offensive end has reached a higher level since Bridges came to the Nets. 84% of his points come from assists from teammates, but Bridges is also a singles player. He can score 2.1 points per round in singles. He can attack the 76ers' weak points after the rotation. The Sixers may give up some points in transition, and the Nets (23rd in offense after the trade deadline) need to seize this stage. The touch of the team's singles master Dinwiddie can, to some extent, determine whether the Nets have a chance to win this series. 3. During Embiid’s rest period, the 76ers have not found a backup center that they can always rely on this season. When Harden was on the court and Embiid was not on the court for 652 minutes, the 76ers scored 0.6 points less per round. However, in the game against the Nets, the 76ers should be able to survive Embiid's rest period. The Nets' substitute level fell to 10th in the league after the trade deadline. But after the 76ers advance, the stability of their substitutes will be further tested. We should learn early on how deep Coach Rivers wants his rotation to be and who he's relying on to keep the team fresh. The No. 5). The Nets will most likely score lower than the 76ers inside the three-point line and at the free throw line in this matchup. Therefore, the Nets may abandon the center and send in five shooters, which is a make-or-break lineup. If the Nets can hit a lot of three-pointers, they'll have a chance to win the game. When the Nets hit 15+ three-pointers this season, their record is 9-1, and when they fail to do so, their record is 4-14. Noteworthy stat: 10.010.0 - Embiid is the seventh player in NBA history to average at least 10 free throws per game. Embiid has hit 661 free throws in 66 games this season. Embiid's free throw rate this season is 58.2 (per 100 attempts), down slightly from 60.2 last season, but Embiid is still fourth among 180 players with at least 500 attempts. And Embiid's 85.7% free throw line shooting rate this season is a career high. Embiid's effective field goal percentage of 57.3% and true shooting percentage of 65.5% this season are both career highs. This is most likely because Embiid has become more efficient in the paint. Embiid's shots in the paint accounted for 59% this season, which is higher than 51% in the past three seasons. Because he is healthier this season, his shooting percentage in the paint is 63.2%, which is also a career high. This is all thanks to James Harden. Embiid hit 491 shots in the paint this season, 174 of which came from Harden's assists, 41 more than the rest of the 76ers combined for 133 times. . Overall, Harden has provided 244 assists to Embiid this season, 89 more than the second-best combination in the league that assists a single teammate.

In one performance, he dug a hole and then stubbornly failed to fill it. In each game, there is no repetition of the script. Are you satisfied with the alliance? Starting the ""Twin Towers"", Da Mo and Bertans both received their first starting opportunity after joining. Pinson, who got his first starting opportunity in his NBA career, got his first triple-double in his NBA career. Bertans scored 17 points in the second quarter, breaking his career single-quarter scoring record. But it's still a pity that they couldn't sweep the Spurs. The season is over and we’ll see you again in the summer league. Red list: Pinson: There is no lead to waste in this game. It’s time to show your true strength.

Ntilikina: He played more than 41 minutes in this game, but his performance was like a microcosm of this season: he was not strong enough, and his basic skills as a point guard were still not good at controlling movement. He wanted to be aggressive but his physical strength was not good enough. McKinley Wright IV: Failed to go further than the 13 points in the last game. I don’t know if I can see this point guard from the University of Colorado, who is also from the University of Colorado like Dinwiddie, in the team next season. Justin Holiday: No matter how hard you try, you can't catch up with a sports car on a bicycle. What's more, I've been riding bicycles my entire career and now I'm at the end of my career. AJ Lawson: After the last game, Kidd did not close the possibility of Lawson returning to the team next season, but maybe the happiness in his head affected his hand. As a shooter, he missed 4 free throws, although there were still some violent blows.

4.89E+15,MB3YenBKT,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"The best sixth man of the season will probably be between Boston's Brogdon and New York's Quickley? Although neither of them averaged 15 points per game - after all, in the past few years, Lou Williams, Clarkson and Herro The explosion of the bench has made people think, ""Can anyone who averages 20 points per game be the Sixth Man of the Year?"" - But they are really not the typical sixth men who shoot and kill birds and go wild: this season, they are both A hero who emerged from adversity and fate by integrating the team and working hard. Brogdon wrote when he came to the Celtics last year: When Brogdon was still in the Bucks, I talked about him like a little Roy - of course, it can also be described as: a guy who used to be 51%+43%+93% Andre Miller Jr. of Basketball. Patience, cunning, smart, sophisticated, low center of gravity, high IQ, good at making things happen through small but smooth changes of direction. What do the Celtics lack? organizer. Brogdon can provide dribbling organization, pick-and-roll instigation, and a fixed-point shooter without blind spots. Although he doesn't look very exciting, Brogdon is a cunning breakthrough master. Brogdon's attitude...he is a second-round pick and a rookie of the year. Of course, Brogdon is not a genius, and his talent is not top-notch, otherwise he would not fall into the second round; but the Celtics do not lack talent at the third overall level, and they want stability. Brogdon is solid. The offensive end is solid. On the defensive end, let's put it this way: against the Raptors in 2019, Coach Bu used him who had just recovered from injury to face Leonard. At least Leonard's lower plate, he did a good job. He has a high EQ and IQ. He has already said thank you to the Pacers for sending him to a place where he can win. He has already said, ""I used to play for performance, but now I play to win."" It's clear: he doesn't want to compete for data, he just competes for championships. of. He helps instigate when he has the ball, so Tatum and Jaylen can concentrate on offense; he can hit open shots when he doesn't have the ball, and the entire Celtics team is happy. So with Brogdon's move, the Celtics not only maintained their original characteristics - swinging defense - but also added stability and organization. His personality also meshes well with the team. Jaylen and Brogdon are both from Atlanta, and their personal relationship off the court is quite good. Now one season is down. Brogdon made 0 starts as a substitute. Third on the team in points per game and fourth on the team in assists per game. Accurately speaking, the three-point rate is 44% and the true shooting rate is 62%. In terms of stability, he averaged 11 baskets, 3 free throws, 15 points, 4 assists, and 1.5 turnovers per game. As for starting 0, he was talking about it two days ago: The life in Boston and the situation with the Celtics are perfect for him. Celtics lineup: Smart and White start with two Jays. The two Jays provide firepower, Smart provides defense changes and ball distribution, and White provides ball control and adaptability. But both Smart and White are not as good as Brogdon: when the situation becomes tense, their ability to handle things with the ball is not stable. Brogdon has the intelligence to adapt to changing circumstances, and at the same time he can get things done: For example, when there were 7 seconds left in 24 seconds, Jaylen was flanked and forced to give the ball to him, Brogdon made a breakthrough pass without thinking: suddenly there was an open basket Just appeared. When White and Brogdon are together, they can often create a situation similar to the Warriors Livingston + Iguodala, ""two golfers muttering about how to break the opponent's safe"" - so many exquisite passes and runs can occur. tacit agreement. This is also the reason why Brogdon is suitable as a substitute: there are two heroes in the starting lineup, and the firepower is enough; there must be someone on the bench who both knows what to do and can do it; the wonderful thing is that Brogdon can replace Smart and White at any time. , but he really doesn't care about the starting position. Brogdon's last season with the Bucks: averaged 29 minutes, 16 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, 1.4 turnovers per game, shooting 51%+43%+93%. After many hardships, he went to the Pacers and suffered a major injury. This season he is a pure sixth man: averaging 26 minutes per game, 15 points, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, 1.5 turnovers, and a shooting percentage of 48%+44%+87%. stable. Speaking of stability, Quickley was also very stable on the Knicks - too stable in fact: a guard who averaged 1 turnover in 22 minutes per game in the first two years of his career. But his desire for stability also resulted in his shooting percentage being less than 40% in the first two seasons. When Quickley was at Kentucky, he was famous for his accuracy on the basket - 43% from three-point range and 92% from the free throw line as a sophomore - but he was a bit evasive. In the past two years, his influence on the Knicks has been immediate. When he came on the court, his rhythm was right, his defense was compact and smart, and he could push the rhythm. However, when it was his turn to play hard, he was nervous when he entered the three-point line and wanted to Use his projectile quickly. Not surprising: he is thin and afraid of confrontation. In this era, everyone who holds the ball wants to be the core of the ball. In the past two years, Quickley's role in the Knicks has been more like a ""3D combo guard""; he is also a bit like the Knicks version of Derek white. In fact, at the beginning of this season, there were rumors in New York that in view of Brunson's arrival, Rose and Quickley were planned to be sent away in a package. Now, one season is down. Quickley is competing for Sixth Man of the Year, and if you say you want to send him away now, Knicks fans will probably swallow up the management. A notable feature of the Knicks this season: the team's three-point leader is power forward Randle, and the three-point record is close to the Knicks' single-season record; the team's two-point leader is point guard Brunson - he every The fourth most games in the league. Except for Mitchell Robinson and Toppin, the others either shot three-pointers or broke out with the ball, looking for pick-and-rolls to open up space and do it boldly. The Knicks rank third in the league in assists per game; second in the league in offensive efficiency per possession: everyone just opens up the space. Quickley then got what he wanted and became confident. In the past, he wanted to shoot once he entered the three-point line, but now he dares to break out and shoot from mid-range. Boldly speed up, go straight to the basket, and make free throws: in the first two months of this season, he made two free throws per game, and last month he made five free throws per game. He still plays without hesitation and plays defense seriously, but with the addition of ball control and confidence, as well as his already solid foundation and diligence, he has now even become the Knicks' starter. Another angle...Quickley went to college at Kentucky and coached Calipari. To this day, Coach Calipari still uses him as an example to tell students: Quickley didn’t look like he could enter the NBA after his freshman season, but he trusted us and we helped him shape his technical style... You guys We should also look at Maxi and Murray. Don't always think about how it is when holding the ball. You should also try your best to develop off-ball skills. After all, most players do not hold the ball 70% of the time... and Calipari The coach's most famous protégé is Derrick Rose. So it's natural that all the brothers like to play horseback riding, archery and throwing - of course, Quickley's talent is far less than that of the brothers, so he has to, in the words of coach Calipari, lay a good foundation and shape his off-ball skills, including baskets. At the beginning of this season, Quickley, who had a very low starting point and was once thought by the coach that he could not enter the NBA after his freshman year, and his senior brother Rose, who became a powerful player in the United States as a freshman and became the youngest MVP in the history of the NBA in his third year, are the Knicks. Sri Lanka's backup double defender. Now that the season is over, Quickley, his junior, is already one of the Sixth Man of the Year, and has even started for the Knicks. Things have changed, people have changed, and the sea has changed. Finally, although I don’t expect to get the Sixth Man of the Year, let’s talk about Portis of the Bucks. This is Portis' eighth season, and his combined salary for the past eight years... is 3 million less than Giannis' salary this season. Giannis will make the first team of the year, and Lopez may become the defensive player of the year. Holiday played his career masterpiece this season and made his second All-Star appearance. Portis is steadily and quietly averaging 14 points and 10 rebounds in 26 minutes per game. He is very diligent and travels everywhere. In 26 minutes per game, he interfered with three-pointers 2.4 times, which is comparable to McDaniels, Bruce Brown and JJJ; but he ran the three-point line and also took care of the basket: 7.4 backcourt rebounds per game, which was the same as Ayton. flat. He is the Bucks' long-spacing man, shooting a three-pointer at a 37% shooting rate per game, with an average shooting range of 13 feet - but he also grabs 2.2 offensive rebounds per game. Blue-collar workers often squat in the penalty area to grab rebounds, and long-range players love to sweep away the perimeter and shoot three-pointers. Portis does everything quietly. He also often used his right waist to face the basket in singles - he was a good guy in college. Yes, which blue-collar NBA player hasn't had his glory days in the academy? Off-topic: In the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals Battle of Tianwang Mountain, Giannis was injured and Portis had 22 points, 8 rebounds and 3 assists. After the Suns led 2-0 in the finals, Coach Bu began to let Portis play more minutes than Lopez. Giannis blasted Ayton directly, and the Bucks made it four consecutive games. We all know that the final form of the Bucks' rush will be for Giannis to play the No. 5 position; for example, the Lakers asked Davis to play the No. 5 position in the 2020 Finals. For example, the Warriors went to the death five when they were anxious. The existence of Portis is: he usually plays steadily and is the third tower of the Bucks' three towers; at the same time, he allows the Bucks to press the switch at any time and create the ultimate formation with Giannis at the 5th position. This is why I want to put Portis next to Brogdon and Quickley. Portis swept everywhere from the three-point line to the penalty area. Quickley started from a very low base and was involved in trade rumors at the beginning of the season. Brogdon entered the NBA in the second round, competed for the starting spot, suffered serious injuries, and was willing to serve as a substitute for the Celtics. After there have been too many cases of ""giving the sixth man unlimited ball rights and leading the second team to score points"", these top sixth men this year can be said to be God's reward for their hard work, and they have made solid changes. destiny.",,,,,3,20,101,4/8/23 19:25,Weibo web version,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hcsiil8qq5g30eg085e84.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hcsiinjxcrg30eg085e84.jpg']",,

The team also suffered a new three-game losing streak, which means that the Mavericks will have little hope of entering the play-offs. Fortunately, the Thunder have also had a poor record recently. Today Another defeat gave the Lone Ranger some theoretical hope. The Mavericks currently have three games left, namely the Kings, Bulls, and Spurs. There is no doubt that the Kings are the most difficult of these three games. If they still want to enter the play-offs, the Mavericks must win these three games. They will face tomorrow.

Although they lost to the Spurs at home, they defeated the Pelicans in the away game today. The team's morale is high and the overall state is Not vulgar. In these games, the team's status has improved with Fox's return. The team's offensive firepower in the past four games has been very strong, at least 120+ points in offensive performance. The core Fox has averaged 24.2 points and 4.3 points per game this season. 6.3 rebounds and 6.3 assists. The introduction of Savoy this year has completely relieved the pressure on Fox.

4.89E+15,MAs8O40lQ,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[1 Has Wiseman improved? 2 Wiggins is back] 1 Wiseman played 20 games with the Pistons, averaging 13.1 points + 8.5 rebounds per game and scoring 7 double-doubles. According to the news, Wiseman’s plus-minus during the same period was at the bottom of the league. In fact, it was not the lowest. Hayes and Ivey on the same team had lower plus-minus than Wiseman during the same period. There are also big brothers like the Rockets and Trail Blazers below. Press. Even looking at the on/off data per 100 rounds, Wiseman is not the lowest point for the Pistons in the same period. When Wiseman is on the court, the Pistons lose 14.6 points per 100 rounds, and when he is not on the court, the Pistons lose 2.8 points per 100 rounds. Hayes in the same period, These two data are -15.3 and -0.5 respectively, and the difference is even larger than Wiseman. I am certainly not saying this to help Huaizi find someone to support him. The Pistons are a bad team, and young people can easily amplify each other's flaws when they are together. After the flaws are superimposed, it is normal for the plus and minus values to rush to the Mariana Trench. Wiseman's pretty good personal panel data is also deceptive. On the surface, in 20 games with the Pistons, he got twice as many double-doubles as his Warriors career. In fact, with increased playing time and slightly modified positioning, it is easy to achieve this effect. . It can be said that the data both overestimates Wiseman's damage (plus and minus values) and overestimates Wiseman's progress (panel data). So, has Wiseman made any progress? There is still improvement, and the area of improvement is the defense, which is statistically more ugly. In the 20 games played by the Pistons, the Pistons lost 10 points more per 100 possessions when Huaizi was on the court. The negative impact on this end seems to be much more serious than the offense where he only scored 2 points less on the court. I say he has improved because Wiseman's defensive starting point is too low. In the first few games of this season, Wiseman was like air on the court. The air may not cause fouls, but Wiseman can. It can be said that he is useless. Worse than his rookie season. Since he has not played a game for more than a year, Wiseman will inevitably feel bad on the court at the beginning of the season. In addition, Cole's all-fresh team will leak inside and outside. As the last barrier, Prince will inevitably be beaten every ball. When he was activated again this season, Huaizi's defense was already better than at the beginning of the season, and it was basically this version after he went to the Pistons. This version probably has this evaluation: You can see that he is a 2.13-meter center. Compared with the past, where he was like a paper man who would bend when squeezed, Wiseman can do some rebounding and block the opponents' pick-and-rolls that don't change much. His size will create some deterrence, and some pick-and-roll players will give up and go straight to the basket. . When defending a one-on-one breakthrough, know how to move sideways, and then rely on your body to cover the opponent's route to the basket. He can have some interference effect with hooks, throws, and jump shots that are a little distance from him. These are all things a center should do. That's pretty much it. Wiseman's defense is still very poor. He can't protect the rim when there is a confrontation, and he can't protect him from some seemingly innocuous impacts. Compared with his rookie season, Wiseman was called on less frequently, but there was a ""one frame slower"" delay when protecting the rim, so there was an effect of being protected but not being able to protect him. His immediate reaction speed may not be his strong point, and he needs more experience support to make full use of his size advantage. As for more complicated situations, such as when the opponent has some passing arrangements in the pick-and-roll, and he is behind him, it will be difficult for him not to lose his position. If Towns' defensive highlights were replaced by Wiseman, it would not be inconsistent at all. As the most important position on the defensive end, the shortcomings of the center are difficult to make up for overall. Even if the Pistons' expectations for Prince are just a puzzle piece, it will be difficult for him to become a player of positive value until his defense completely evolves. Confrontation can be practiced, and after gaining strength, some aspects can be improved, but the defensive business cannot be completely repaired, otherwise the Timberwolves would not give up on the prospect of Towns playing the 5th position. The part where Wiseman has greater potential is on offense. During the Warriors' era, Cole's system required the center to act as a support point, to do a lot of screens, and to constantly observe and read to cooperate with the main attacker in the backcourt to play varied and random game content. This is of course something Wiseman doesn't understand. He even has no intention of seriously covering. The cooperation with the shooter cannot provide any value related to ""development"". Wiseman is only suitable for playing one role in the Warriors - the end point of cutting from the baseline to eat the pie when Ku Chai is in the pick-and-roll. But the Warriors will not always chase pick-and-roll starters. Wiseman must go to the top of the arc to participate in tactics when he comes out. What he needs is a fake pick-and-roll early to get an alley-oop or catch the ball near the basket and turn around for a hook. What Curry needs is a high-quality screen, or support after Curry throws the ball, and the two of them can't even piss in the same pot. Wiseman averaged 0.7 assists per game. He provided 13 assists but made 32 turnovers in 20 games with the Pistons. The problem of screening has not changed fundamentally with the Warriors. His firm will to only be responsible for finishing has been consolidated in the Pistons. This kind of play that is completely focused on me requires the pick-and-roll player who cooperates with him to be prepared: he must have the awareness to get rid of the defense completely by relying on his personal ability, especially after entering the three-point line, he can slow down and play in the mid-range. one. Because the center does not provide cover, and it is impossible to get the ball back after it is given to the center, the shooting space is almost entirely created by the pick-and-roll player. A guard who relies on height and strength to slow down and shoot, mid-range, and feed will be more suitable for Wiseman than a guard who uses screens to shoot with the ball. CC has some basic conditions that meet the requirements, but objectively speaking, until CC makes significant progress, he is only on the right path, and his ability is still open to question. This is a bit embarrassing. Wiseman is a player who completely needs his teammates to create an environment for him, but cannot create an environment for his teammates. His ability requirements for pick-and-roll partners are not low, but he can only produce a finishing firepower that is one level lower than Ayton. Except for In addition, other areas - defense, screening, ball handling - are much worse. For a center with core treatment, this input-output ratio is too low, because it is three second-round picks. Lakers version of Thomas Bryant can do things better, Wiseman is not even close to this small goal. It is also difficult for Wiseman to completely transform into a low-player puzzle style. He can shoot three-pointers and is not as threatening as a space-based inside line. He has the size and athletic ability, but he doesn't have enough strength or energy to fight for a lot of front boards, so don't expect him to do a job similar to Miro. What is the concept? Wiseman is the real ""Prince"". The order of ""Prince"" and the style of play of ""Master"". He is not an arrogant person, he is low-key, friendly, humble, and likeable when he is not on the court. But he has indeed never done a good job as a puzzle player. Whether it is adding some direction or personal will, he always goes to the core, but the NBA cannot provide him with an environment for core play. This misalignment of needs and direction is partly due to luck. His career started on a winning team with a championship core team, rather than a bad team that could be built entirely around him. But the objective reality is that in the current NBA, there is really no such thing as a center forward who is not good at defense and is only responsible for finishing. The Pistons can give Wiseman half a season to try and make mistakes. What happens after this year’s draft? Can the Pistons, who have a lot of insiders, be able to persist like this in the future? After all the calculations, there are only 82+4 games left on the 4-year rookie contract. Time flies by quickly, and the NBA doesn’t have much patience. 2 Wiggins is back. He persisted in training while away from the team and may play against the Kings or Trail Blazers. This is good news for the Warriors. Not only will Wiggins not miss the first round, he will not need to find his form again after the playoffs begin. The question is, the Warriors have always had a pattern of losing when new variables are introduced this season. Will this continue? Before Curry returned and lost, the Warriors spent some time adapting to the new rotation method. Now there is no cost of trial and error. After losing to the Timberwolves and Nuggets, in order to ensure that they did not play in the play-offs, the Warriors played each of the next three games. Can't afford to lose, Cole must find the correct rotation answer immediately, or only give the team and Wiggins one game of running-in time. In fact, Kerr hasn't even solved the rotation issue once Payton returns. Payton played 4 games with the Warriors. His personal performance was no different from last season, but his plus and minus values were -9, -14, 13, and -12 respectively. It is true that the positive and negative values of a single game in a small sample are accidental. The pattern of Payton winning points when playing the second position and losing points when playing the third position also exists. Another situation is that Lamb only shot 29.5% from three-point range after being activated again. Compared to Kuminga, Lamb is the space point at the fourth position that Cole trusts more. Especially when using Payton, Cole is more inclined to put Lamb or even Thompson at the fourth position to balance space and leadership. Defend. This method of employment actually neutralizes the defensive advantage that Payton brought back. This is the problem that Wiggins has to solve when he returns, and it is also the difference between his return and the return of Curry and Payton - he fills the position where the Warriors are most short-handed, and the return of Curry and Payton has aggravated the problem. The Warriors have a size disadvantage. Especially after Payton returned, Jaglin also withdrew from the rotation at the same time. Even if the latter's defense is far inferior to the former, removing an inside size and adding a point guard size, the impact of high downgrade cannot be ignored. Wiggins is the Warriors' starting small forward. His return will not only take up one person's time, but no matter whose time he takes up, the Warriors cannot become shorter. The hidden danger is what level Wiggins' personal status is. He played very poorly before leaving the team and did not play with the team for a short period of time. He came back immediately without playing for the Thunder, which also shows that both he and the team need some buffering and transition. Moreover, there is currently no confirmation that Wiggins' personal problems have been completely resolved, and there are also questions about his mental state. Wiggins is back, but not plug-and-play, immediately turning the Warriors back to their best. He needs some recovery time, and Cole's answer to adjusting the rotation is unknown. But no matter what, this is much better than him not returning. At least now, the team's upper limit has been raised, and there is some possibility of solving the Warriors' problem of not taking into account both space and size. This season, the Warriors have almost made people shout ""the championship is back"" many times, but in the end they all ended with a shitty loss. Wiggins' return is the last reinforcement of this season and the Warriors' last chance to shout this sentence. Good luck to the Warriors.

4.89E+15,MApB77evA,5700928397,The good fortune of three lives 1234,"just saw that Wiggins of the Warriors is returning, which makes me feel very emotional. I found a particularly magical place is the Warriors team. One thing about him that makes people think about him is that he has at least five players in his team who are indispensable to this team. If one person is missing, you will find his This combat effectiveness will drop significantly. Well, obviously their personal abilities are very, very strong. This is very strange. If you think of Curry, he won’t say it. The star library of the star team has gravity. From an offensive aspect, if Curry is gone, what will happen? It's easy to play, but Curry missed that period and still won five games in a row. Well, but everyone knows what Curry means to the Warriors. He is the real cornerstone of the Warriors' system, another Thompson. Only Thompson can open up more space for Curry. Thomson is arguably the best three-point shooter in NBA history besides Curry. Its role is also indispensable for the Warriors. The other Green is the core of the Warriors' defense and is indispensable. Then there is Wiggins, a leading defensive player with stable scoring ability, and the best talent, without him. It is obvious that the Warriors have a much harder time playing games. Another Rooney Yong is a true forward inside, stable and efficient. There are often very important moments at critical moments, where they perform very dazzlingly, and almost every one of them has stood up at critical moments, and they all have their own battle to become famous. Even Payton Jr. and even DiVincent are so important, but look at the three strongest teams in the NBA this year, the Bucks, Celtics and Suns. What makes these three teams so strong? where? As for the person who is the strongest star player, even if he is not playing games, others can still win most of the games. This is why they are so strong. The Warriors are at the other extreme. They have five people in their team, at least five people, and they can't do without anyone. In fact, it feels much worse. This feeling is amazing. If you talk about a team, it relies on its star player. It's completely understandable. You said that if the star of a team doesn't play, I can still win. This is really awesome. You talk about a team. Relying on at least five players is simply unbelievable. My understanding is the system of the Warriors team. He can achieve 1+1>2, and can maximize the potential of any player in the system, and his role positioning for all players in this system is very clear. The advantage of such a team is that if the team is healthy, the ceiling is extremely high. The disadvantage is that because the roles are too clear, it gives people the feeling that they are all indispensable. In fact, other teams also have this main player. If he is injured and does not play, it will have an impact on the team's combat effectiveness, but I don't feel that I have the courage to be so extreme.",,,,,0,0,0,4/4/23 12:38,Redmi 7,,,

On March 31, the 2022-23 NBA regular season continued, and the Milwaukee Bucks ushered in a focus battle with the Boston Celtics. After the whole game, the Celtics outplayed the Bucks in three quarters and defeated their opponents 140-99. Focus player: In this game, Green Army core Jayson Tatum showed amazing efficiency. He made 12 of 18 from the field, 8 of 10 three-pointers, 8 of 8 free throws, and scored 40 points and 8 rebounds. For the Bucks, Antetokounmpo's performance was sluggish. He made 11 of 27 shots and scored 24 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 steal and 1 block.

Game review: At the beginning of the first quarter, Holiday hit a three-pointer, and the Bucks took the lead, but soon, Jaylen Brown also scored a three-pointer, and the Greens responded in kind. After that, the two sides experienced a brief tug-of-war. By the middle of the quarter, Jaylen Brown turned over and succeeded in a jumper, and the two sides tied at 17. But in the latter part of this quarter, the Green Army gradually set off a climax. Entering the last minute of this quarter, Brogdon succeeded in a layup. Tatum also hit a layup and a step-back jumper. On the Bucks' side, Middleton The layup barely stopped the team's losses. At the end of the single quarter, the Celtics temporarily led 34-26. In the second quarter, Robert Williams scored a dunk and Tatum also hit a three-pointer, bringing the point difference to double digits. Since then, the Bucks have become more passive. Antetokounmpo's breakthrough hook shot into the net to score points for the team, but on the outside, the Bucks' shooters collectively misfired. Seizing the Bucks' slump, the Green Army quickly set off an offensive frenzy. By the middle of this quarter, Tatum scored two free throws, and the visiting team led by more than 20 points. The Bucks also tried to revive their morale by calling timeouts and making substitutions, but it never worked.

In addition, the home team shot 22 three-pointers in the first two quarters and hit only 3 goals. Changing sides and fighting again, Horford made a tip-in, and the Green Army took the lead again. Since then, the Green Army has always maintained an advantage of more than 30 points. The Bucks made matters worse. Outside general Middleton was elbowed by Jaylen Brown during a defense and his mouth was bleeding and he had to receive stitches. After the interlude, the Green Army continued to pursue and fight fiercely, but the Bucks showed signs of being defeated. With 3 minutes left in this quarter, Tatum hit consecutive three-pointers, and the point difference exceeded the 40 mark. Matthews, Connaughton and other supporting players succeeded in shooting, barely covering up the Bucks. After three quarters, the Bucks continued to fall behind 74-114.

4.89E+15,MzGLX8WXy,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"Today is probably a good day for Suns fans: Durant is back. At the same time, one of his previous trade chips, Suns favorite Bridges Bridges, quietly scored 27 points for the Brooklyn Nets; Cameron Johnson scored 31 points. The team's lineup is complete, and the kids who ran away are playing well. very good. Although people have left, the bridge has not forgotten Phoenix. After scoring 44 points a few days ago, he admitted that he benefited a lot from watching Booker and Paul in Phoenix. When he played for the Suns this season, he averaged 14 shots, 3 free throws and 17 points per game; in Brooklyn, he averaged 18 shots, 7 free throws and 27 points per game. In his five seasons with the Suns, he shot 26% at the basket and 42% from three-point range; at the net, 14% and 36%. In five seasons with the Suns, the assist ratio on two-pointers was 72%, and on the net, it was 41%. In the Suns, he is mainly responsible for quick kicks, fixed-point three-pointers, and baseline catching attacks. In net, he is a ball-handling attacker. Coach Vaughn praised Ohashi, ""Free throws, basket attacks, three-pointers, early offense - pull-up jumpers or creation with the ball - seize opportunities. We have high expectations for him, and I look forward to seeing his growth."" Ohashi Withstood it. There is no doubt about basket attacks and three-pointers: in the 2021 Finals, although he lost, he shot 43% of the three-pointers. There is no need to doubt his ability to seize opportunities and attack the basket: in four of his six career series, his shooting rate was above 51%. He has always been a perfect 3-and-D player, and now he's looking like a star. It was supposed to be a story about changing teams and soaring to the top, ""you didn't make the most of me before"", but is it better for Bridges to study in Phoenix? In other words, there are two examples of 3D players becoming stars: George and Leonard. George entered the game as a shooter, and Granger became the Pacers' ace after his injury. Leonard is a capable defensive player. He won the Finals MVP in his third year, Defensive Player of the Year in his fourth year, and All-Star in his fifth year. What George lacked when he entered the industry was his ability to handle the ball. Later, he developed a skill in passing and pick-and-roll: although now under high pressure, he still dribbles high and his breakthrough is still not enough, but it is enough. Leonard entered the industry with broad shoulders, long arms and a low center of gravity, but he had no basketball: 25% three-point shooting rate and 74% free throw shooting rate in college, and 77% free throw shooting rate in his first year with the Spurs. Afterwards, Coach Chip asked him to practice basketball, and Popovich asked him to watch Jordan's video. By the 2015-16 season, Leonard shot 51% + 44% + 87%, and he became more alive with the ball. . Most 3D players have some basketball skills, and being able to defend shows that their bodies are not much different. So as long as you are willing to practice - focusing on holding the ball and the basket - and practice accordingly, there is hope. Before Daqiao entered the industry in 2018, NBADRAFT gave Daqiao a list: running and jumping 8, size 9, defense 9, shooting 9, that is, combat power 9, agility 8 - perfect ready-made 3D. What's limiting him? Passing 6, Dribbling 7, Strength 7. Everything is good without the ball, but terrible with the ball. Thin, unable to advance, unable to spread. Alan Smith's scouting report said Ohashi, ""spending time in college with Brunson, gave him no chance to develop his isolation and creative abilities."" Indeed, when there are good ball handlers in the team, it is not easy for 3D to stand out. George took off because Granger was injured. But you can learn from watching a good ballhandler play: as long as you put your mind to it. After all, all the scouting reports say: Ohashi is studious and hard-working. Ohashi spent his rookie period next to Booker and Paul, the two mid-range shooters, and was influenced by his experience. ""Getting to the free throw line and playing fiercely is very important. I came from Phoenix and watched a lot of Booker and Paul play, and I learned a lot."" He was the Suns' chief defender, so, ""I learned from top defensive players. A lot of times, my opponents were too smart, and many of my fouls were stupid. But I learned a lot of tricks from them. If you make a bold move, good things will happen."" ""Learned."" Most of the perfect 3D players have baskets and bodies; what’s one step away from becoming a star? Handling the ball, and reading the game. Then learn it. Magic coach Mosley said of Ohashi, ""He just knows how to play the game."" How do you know? Learned. For example, he is now very good at getting up and moving toward the middle, tricking the opponent's center of gravity into moving, and then he has time to go straight to the baseline, grab a shoulder, take off, and make a mid-range shot. ——This trick is also commonly used by Booker. For example, he is now very good at dribbling with his right hand to break through. The non-dribbler and non-dribble shoulder can protect the ball, force the opponent to retreat, and then take a step back. ——This trick is also commonly used by Paul. Today he just made a move to the free throw line without the ball, jumped to catch the ball, took a quick dribble, turned in the air and shot a jump shot. ——He used to watch Booker often for this move. He has left Phoenix, but the traces left by Paul and Booker are still vivid in his mind. Daqiao is a sensible young man, so when talking about Phoenix, he still says, ""I have learned a lot."" Originally, from college to the NBA, everyone had to watch the ball handler have unlimited firing rights. He could only be a 3D player and had to guard against the sharp knives on the opposite side. There is no chance of being in the spotlight, and doing the most hard work. But Ohashi’s attitude is: you can learn from being 3D – and you have indeed learned. In an article published by the New York Post three days ago, Ohashi said six periods in total, but said learn three times. The final summary is also a simple and unpretentious sentence: Sojust learning.",,,,,17,38,262,3/30/23 18:31,Weibo web version,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hci2d48130g30eg085kjo.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hci2da2ff8g30eg085x6s.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 005ztwqOgy1hci2dmitkwg30eg085hdw.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hci2drdkepg30eg0857wk.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hci2du459kg30eg085 hdv.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg. cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hci2dx6wuag30eg085npf.jpg']",,

Bain played very well: he scored 31 points, 4 rebounds and 5 assists on 8-of-19 shots. His personal plus-minus value was as high as +14, the team's highest. Porzingis 32+13+6 If the Wizards want to reach the playoffs, they must have their record ranked in the play-off area, so that they can have a chance to win a playoff spot. So in the home game against the Celtics, Bill and Kuzma were unable to play, and the pressure was placed on Porzingis's shoulders.

Original subtitles are for communication only and are not professional translations. To talk about my feelings about this tactical explanation, I can only express it as ""fate"", because there are really too many inextricable relationships: 1. The ""Hammer"" tactic was born more than 20 years ago and was coached by George Karl. The Bucks, after experiencing so many changes, the current Bucks have coincidentally been cited by NBA officials as an example of ""Hammer"" tactical explanation, just like a destined reincarnation. 2. The ""Hammer"" tactic has always been translated as ""Hammer Tactics"" because many people just translate it literally and don't know that ""Hammer"" is actually not an object, but a word derived from a ""person's name"". This person is the former hero. Deer assistant coach DarvinHam (Ham), ""Ham"" → ""Hammer"". I have shared this story before. O Web link. Coincidentally, Hamm happened to be an assistant coach in the Bucks before, which created an opportunity for the prototype character of the ""Hammer"" tactic to explain his own tactics in person. There is an arrangement in the underworld. 3. After the birth of ""Hammer"", it has been continuously improved and then flourished in the Spurs. As the chief assistant coach of the Spurs during their heyday, Budenholzer coincidentally became the head coach of the Bucks many years later, so it is perfect for him to explain the ""Hammer"" tactics. 4. Budenholzer and Ham have coincidentally worked together for 9 years, which is why they facilitated this joint explanation. So many coincidences can actually come together, which makes this tactical explanation feel like a miracle to me. As the prototype of the ""Hammer"" tactic, Ham shared from a coach's first perspective what to pay attention to when defending ""Hammer"", which is to pay attention to the positional relationship between the shooter and the big man. ""When you see the shooter in the high post, and When big men are wandering around the mid-range, you have to pay attention at that time, they may want to hit 'Hammer'."" I think this is the most useful part of this series of coaches explaining tactics. Every time you can hear how professional coaches Understand tactics. Budenholzer's understanding of the ""Hammer"" tactic also reflects that modern basketball is becoming more and more positionless (positionless). Big men have more skills, and the roles of screening and being screened are also changing, which makes the design of tactics can become richer. #NBA大有天kun#LiHoopScout video Weibo video of the backup account",,,,"NBA Coaches Corner, NBA has great potential",26,9,89,3/29/23 16:57,Weibo video account,,"http://f.video.weibocdn.com/u0/KgQVS8hZgx086OGco7le01041201RkbJ0E010.mp4?label=mp4_720p&template=1280x720.25.0&ori=0&ps=1BVp4ysnknHVZu&Expires=1694324215&ssig=LGCU2 dAJNn&KID=unistore,video",

This is nothing more than a way to belittle the value of Kobe's championship. Do you really understand the championship that year? Kobe has never won by lying down. Let's take a look at the process: In the first game of the Finals, O'Neal scored 43+19. The Lakers defeated the Pacers. Although Kobe only scored 14 points on 6-of-13, Kobe beat the opponent's Miller, the leading scorer, only defended 1 of 16. Miller, the leading shooter in history, only shot 6% from the field. This assassin, who even Jordan didn't take seriously, was completely restricted. This is Kobe's role, and it cannot be reflected just by scoring. At the beginning of Game 2, Kobe was maliciously stepped on by Jalen Rose, causing a grade 3 strain to leave the game early. This was also the worst game for Kobe to be criticized. His injuries were all blamed, so there is probably nothing to blame. Although Kobe only scored 2 points and 4 assists due to injury and left the field early to receive treatment, his plus-minus value was the highest on the team. In Game 3, Kobe was absent due to injury. Miller, who was the main defender, was full of firepower. He scored 33 points on 11 of 22 in the game and led the team to victory. Without Kobe's defense, Miller broke out and the Lakers lost the game. This is Kobe. The best proof of its effect. In Game 4, Kobe came back from injury to guard Miller. The two sides entered overtime. O'Neal left the game with 6 fouls. Kobe took over the game and made all 4 shots at the last moment to kill the game. After the game, O'Neal was interviewed by the media. O'Neal said: ""It was Kobe who saved me and the team."" Even O'Neal acknowledged the importance of Kobe in the game. I don't know what some fans have to blame. If Kobe is not there, On the defensive end, without Kobe's forced comeback, the Lakers' championship would probably be a long shot, so Kobe's first championship is not considered a casual win. #Kobe##KobeBryant##欧Neill#",,,,"Kobe Bryant, O'Neal",0,1,0,3/26/23 23:38,NBA Super Talk,['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/005wX7iFly1hcdorp7n8jj30qo0wljx7.jpg'],,

The Emperor played at staggered peaks in the first and third quarters and carried the main attack in the final quarter. Some of the game plans were well executed. Some of the problems exposed are actually not problems. For example, today's substitutes were poor in offense. Niangshen and Reid originally needed Harden to feed the ball to activate better. Today, they just couldn't get the usual opportunity ball. For example, Embiid's predicament when he was flanked during the decisive battle would be much better if Harden started with the ball. There are also some inherent problems, such as Tucker's inability to respond to empty shots. It would be awkward to stand on the same side as Embiid on a night when his hand is not good. The two of them passed the ball to each other twice tonight. Green completely left Tucker open to protect the frame, which did too much damage to Philadelphia's offense. And if Damai is used at the fourth position, there will also be the problem of unstable shooting. Using Niangshen, having Harris on the defensive end at the same time will also be a big problem. For example, Embiid defends and retreats a lot. On the opposite side, there are shooters like Tangshen Poole. Once the three-point touch is developed, it will be very troublesome. Once Embiid defends the penalty area, the quality of the second frame protection point is not enough and the rebound protection problem is huge. There is no perfect solution to these two problems for Philadelphia, and indeed there is no perfect team. Every strong team has problems to worry about.

Days earlier, another injury threatened his next season, and the Los Angeles Lakers big man was reaching his breaking point. ""I was like, shaking,"" Davis told ESPN last week, shaking his hands to illustrate his state that December day. ""I'm just angry and sad...frustrated."" On Dec. 16, Davis felt a jolt when he made a routine inside move over Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic to score. Pain, indicating a complex problem in his right foot: a bone spur broke off the scaphoid, which also had a stress reaction. Doctors speculate that this vital weight-bearing bone may have been chipped away while he was in college at the University of Kentucky, but the bone bruises exacerbated the condition. Davis rated the pain level as an 8 or 9 out of 10. For a guy who's been through as much physical adversity as Davis has been through, there's some experience behind that estimate. Medical staff said the injury could sideline him for eight to 10 weeks. So, with nowhere to hide from the pain in his foot and the agony caused by the condition, Davis barricaded himself in a closet at home. Soon, his wife Maren and 6-year-old daughter Nora found Davis lying on the ground. ""She whispered to my wife, 'Mom, what's wrong with dad?'"" Davis recalled. ""She wanted to come over and hug me, but she didn't dare. So my wife said, 'It's okay.' ""I saw her and I was like, 'Don't touch me.' But she came over and gave me a quick hug and then she left and she sat down and said, 'Mom, I'll be right back. I have an idea. '"" Nora hurried away, and Davis' serious demeanor had begun to fade as he switched back to dad mode. But, he wanted to see what Nora would do when she came back, so he stayed on the floor, covering his head with his hands face. ""At this point, I was trying to act,"" Davis said, laughing at the absurdity of the scene. A few minutes later, Nora came back and placed a piece of paper on the pile of clothes next to him."" Dad, everything's going to be okay,"" Nala said. The 2012 No. 1 pick has shaped his reputation as a two-way talent over the past two seasons, both in terms of the time Davis spent rehabbing and the time he played. Just as much -- missing 78 of 154 games. What makes this setback especially frustrating is that, after strengthening his body during the offseason, he entered training camp confident enough to declare his goal Played 82 regular season games. Now, after failing to make the playoffs last season and starting 2-10 this season, Davis will miss more than 30 games. For him, for the team, for him and LeBron For James, the 38-year-old all-time great, things were shaping up to be a wasted year. Davis' family chose not to bother him, and anger welled up within him. — until he grabbed the piece of paper Nora had given him. “There’s a damn rainbow,” Davis said, eyes wide. “She just drew a rainbow because she liked rainbows, or maybe this girl really Very clever..."" Davis paused, a smile on his face. ""At the end of every storm there's a damn rainbow. ""While Davis' time in Los Angeles had a storybook start, ending his first season with a championship in the 2020 NBA bubble, there have been as many cloudy days as sunny days since then.

Davis suffered a groin injury that caused him to leave In the fourth game, he missed the fifth game and played only 5 minutes in the sixth game. Last season, the Lakers failed to enter the playoffs. Davis was injured from December 19 due to a knee injury and ankle sprain. Missing 36 of 46 games through April 1, the Lakers finished with a 33-49 record. His body betrayed him, not only dimming Davis' star image - he had been drafted for the eighth consecutive year. After the All-Star Game, James has not been selected to the All-Star Game in the past two seasons - and has stalled the succession plan to take over the Lakers. In the game against the Miami Heat, James averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game. Score won the 2020 Finals MVP, while Davis maintained his own level, contributing 25 points, 10.7 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks. As recent injuries have affected James, Davis Davis has yet to fully prove his status as the next franchise player in Los Angeles given his own availability. This season, with James recovering from a right foot injury since February 26, the Lakers are chasing a playoff berth, and Day Weiss will lead them. ""Obviously, I have a huge role in this,"" Davis said. ""There are high expectations for my performance and leadership. Not just for myself, but for my team, my coaches and the entire franchise. Davis never intended to carry the torch with James sidelined, but he accepted the responsibility. ""I think any time you play anywhere with another star and that guy is out for the game, you try your best to Just try to isolate yourself and not put too much pressure on yourself, everyone is looking for you to fill those shoes, or at least half of the shoes, while the rest of the team fills the other half,"" Davis said. ""So for me He's going to be out there for a long time and everybody's looking at me like, 'Okay, AD, we need you to carry us until we can get our full roster back now. Before James' injury, the duo found themselves under the microscope in the most high-profile Lakers game of the season, as the 20-season veteran was closing in on the NBA's all-time scoring record. On Feb. 7 against Oklahoma City James passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's milestone with a fadeaway jumper late in the third quarter against the Homer Thunder, and he floated across the court with his arms spread in the air in celebration as Davis sat on the bench, expression stoically while other Lakers players cheered. What the cameras missed, Davis said, was that shortly before the record-setting shot, he trudged to the bench tunnel at Crypto.com Arena and let out a frustrated scream. As he watched his team have another lackluster night against a mid-level opponent, he knew every play mattered. When Davis returned to the court, he said he was a little dazed and unconscious. to James' historic moment. ""From the outside, they didn't know,"" Davis said, saying he felt his body language was bad. ""They shouldn't know, but LeBron and I were fine. Of course, you can tell when we've had a good time. But I think people are just looking for a story. He unflinchingly described their relationship. ""My relationship with LeBron is one that I think is one of the best partners or teammates in the NBA, no matter what,"" Davis said. ""But they didn't see that. at this point. They don’t see what we do off the field or the time we hang out together. What they see is what's on the field. ""The relationship allowed James to teach Davis how to be a leader. Lakers point guard Dennis Schroder, now in his second with the team, saw a difference in Davis."" It's a lot better than the first time I came here,"" Schroeder told ESPN. More Voices.... I mean, I didn't know him when I first came here. But he's done a great job this year. I think he's Also learned from LeBron. Communicating with teammates, especially on the defensive end. It’s a big growth from the first year to this year.” On March 11, the 11-year veteran turned 30 Birthday. His priorities are clearer. James, who has thrived in the spotlight since he was a teenager, is an open book — spending time with Davis whether in the locker room or wherever life takes them. ""He (LeBron) obviously taught me a lot about the game and leadership,"" Davis said. ""I think I'm more effective when he's not playing because I have to. He's not here....(Usually) I go out there and let him do the talking. But when he's not here, we need someone to speak out His own voice, and it was like, 'Okay, this is my time to speak up.'"" Davis defied doctors' predictions and returned on Jan. 25, missing only 20 games. James' guidance may also have had an impact. ""The way he takes care of his body: constant massage, constant lifting, therapy ... all of those things I learned and incorporated into my daily life to get as many plays as possible,"" Davis said . He's made the most of his recent absence, talking to the coaching staff and putting in the work on film — something that wasn't a habit when he first arrived in Los Angeles. ""As much as I don't like getting hurt, I use it as a period of time,"" Davis said. Time to improve mentally and study the game more."" ""Then when I get back on the floor, I'm ready."" Not only is Davis back, he's back to playing at a high level. In 25 games before the foot injury, he averaged 27.4 points and 12.1 rebounds. The Lakers are three games below their winning percentage. In the 22 games since his comeback, he averaged 24.1 points and 12.8 rebounds per game, and the Lakers' winning rate exceeded 50% in 4 games. In Wednesday's game against the Suns, Davis scored 20 points, 5 rebounds and 3 assists after halftime to help the Lakers seal the victory and maintain 10th place in the Western Conference Finals. ""He's a fucking monster,"" Lakers guard Austin Reeves told ESPN. ""I think he doesn't get the credit he deserves as a basketball player. I think people see the loss and blame him for it. Obviously it's important to get playing time, but as a basketball player, I feel like There aren't many guys with his size and skill level."" Now the Lakers are tasked with making the playoffs with nine games remaining. ""I think we've built the team we want to be,"" Davis said. ""It started with our defense, coming back from the battle and still not having LeBron.... ""We came together really quickly and were able to make some noise and get people to notice us again. I just try to go into every game with the mindset that I have to win and dominate, and the rest will take care of itself. ""To some extent, the Lakers' final regular season game and any postseason will be an extended audition to convince the front office to field the same core next season. In addition to Davis and James, the Lakers Nearly all key players will need to make decisions on their contracts this summer, including recent acquisitions D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Jared Vanderbilt, Mizuho Hachimura Mo Bamba. “If we actually had a full summer, a full training camp, go through a full season, who knows where we’d be,” Davis said. “…The team we have right now, we feel Not only can we make noise this year, but honestly, I like our chances against anyone. You put anybody against us, I'm bullish on our chances....who knows who we're going to be next year and who knows what threats we're going to face if they can hold this team together. ""He has already seen the similarities between this year's lineup and the 2020 championship team. ""We have fewer big men, that's for sure, but I think with Russell, Fanye, and Beasley, we have another big man. Having that lineup for once,"" Davis said. ""Beasley played the shooter role for KCP (Kentavious Caldwell-Pope). Russell is like Rondo's ball-handling magic, Fan Ye and his AC (Alex Caruso) role. Even having Hachimura play the role of Kuz (Kyle Kuzma). So, obviously, this team is special....but I think this team has the potential to be that team. Last offseason, while watching a documentary on Netflix, Davis heard a line that stuck with him: ""The giant looked in the mirror and saw nothing."" ""The 6-foot-10 Davis, who has earned more than $200 million in his career, considers himself a true giant and doesn't consider himself better or different than others. ""When I start from myself,"" Davis said, When you put it into perspective, it's like no matter how old you get, you should be able to look at yourself in the mirror. ""So I shouldn't have a big head, I should look in the mirror first and check myself."" Right?"" He liked the phrase so much that he had it tattooed on his left thigh, in about 150-point font size. He also had a tattoo on his back, from the image of a basketball hoop in his backyard to his From the precocious image of wearing sports goggles in high school, to the NCAA championship trophy he won at Kentucky, to being the No. 1 pick in the 2012 NBA draft, to the Larry O'Brien Trophy he won with the Lakers."" It says in the middle, 'Start with a dream,'"" Davis said. He wants to add to the franchise by continuing his dream with the Lakers. He has two years left on his contract -- with a player option for the second season -- Stay consistent with James' contract. ""Being part of a legacy of winning championships, you want to win more,"" Davis said. ""We were tied with the Celtics for the 17th championship, and it's like, I want to be on the team As a member, our team won 18 championships and made this team No. 1. ""Seeing Pau Gasol raise his No. 16 jersey to the crossbar last month made Davis think that one day his No. 3 jersey would be there too. ""I love living in Los Angeles. , my family also likes it. I love playing for the Lakers,"" Davis said. ""When the time comes, honestly, I'm not sure the direction the team wants to go, who knows what conversations we'll have. But when the time comes, we sit down, have those conversations, and go from there. ""Whatever options he had, Davis would have considered the comfort of his family, which also includes two children, Jayce and Kellan, if not more so than basketball. ""Everything I do is for My baby,"" Davis said. He hopes the Lakers' season is far from over. But that glimmer of hope might not have been so if Nora hadn't drawn a rainbow on a pile of clothes in the corner of his bedroom closet. The rush came to him and stayed with him so profoundly. ""That's when I suddenly gasped and went, 'Damn,'"" Davis said. “I went and grabbed her and hugged her and I was fine after that. ""Like, 'Okay, let's get to work.'""",,,,,230,384,3932,3/24/23 21:49,👑💛iPhone client,['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/00634wlrly1hcbado84imj30u013oguh.jpg'],,
4.88E+15,MyMkCDNJI,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Brother Kazi stabilized the morale of the army, but the Thunder still tried a lot of content] In the first quarter, Kazi was 7 of 7. CIC, CIC, also see CIC. There is no solution to the truth, with three big words written on his face: No problem! Starting with full firepower, it is natural to have an attitude. The Clippers, which have had many twists and turns over the years, finally seem to be on the right track. Something happened to George again. Even the most staunch Clippers believers, after being repeatedly played by fate, can't help but ask whether the Feng Shui of this team is real. has a problem. After 4 years of integration, if they can't produce any results, George's injury may not be the last wave that overturns the small boat. Not to mention people's panic, countless pairs of eyes inside and outside the team are waiting to see their response, that's for sure. Therefore, Ka Zi expressed his stance when he came up. Don’t be teary-eyed if you are a member of the team, and don’t be full of smiles if you are watching the fun. After all, this team still has the surname Lun. I haven’t fallen yet. Are you all panicking? It didn't take long for Leonard to make the Thunder realize that they did not have enough single-defense resources to deal with this mecha warrior. Dort was able to withstand him with his skill. After all, the size was not enough for the model, so there was no need to talk about the others. So the Thunder quickly entered the rhythm of flanking. They did not shy away from this defensive strategy. flanking the ball holder is a common part of the Thunder's defensive system, and the cost is that the Clippers will get some outside opportunities. Under Katz's fierce offensive, the Clippers did not defeat the Thunder immediately for two reasons: First, the Thunder had stars with matching firepower. In the first half, Kaziko scored 15 points on 7-for-7 shooting, with 2 assists and 1 turnover. SGA scored 19 points on 7 of 12 shots, with 3 assists and 2 turnovers. Just as the Thunder can't match up with Kazi's forwards, the Clippers can't match up with SGA's players either. With speed, size, flexibility, defensive experience, and multiple comprehensive conditions, George, who is relatively suitable for guarding SGA, is injured; secondly, the Thunder are starting to After flanking Leonard, the Clippers responded poorly in the second quarter. Although the three-point touch has a certain degree of randomness, Westbrook does need to add a passing process when realizing the bonus of his opponent's double attack on Leonard. The Thunder rotate quickly, and delaying the opportunity often means falling short. On a night when Morris can't hit a three-pointer, there's no point playing. Most of the Clippers' 6 turnovers in the second quarter were due to their own failure to understand. Westbrook is not very easy to use in certain situations in some games. This is not a new conclusion. Lu's need to use Westbrook flexibly was originally an issue that the Clippers would inevitably face in this year's playoffs. As for why Morris can still sit firmly in the starting lineup and whether Lu is playing a big game, that is not something that can be explained clearly at the technical and tactical level. How did the Clippers defeat the Thunder? Hyland's deal worked wonders at this time. I'm sure Hylander won't be in this state every game, but he played a huge role in that wave at the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter. Hyland did two things. First, he used Leonard to attract a flanker and hit a fixed-point three-pointer. Second, he broke through the pick-and-roll to find an open teammate to assist in the three-pointer. Seven of the eight three-pointers made by Hyland and Batum occurred in this connection period, directly defeating the game. The winning lineup of the Clippers is not a full-space lineup with five outsiders, but a four-shooter lineup with center (Plumlee). But the space was enough, because the Clippers fully changed their defensive formation and gathered enough Thunder defenders on the strong side, and then found the weak-side shooter in 1 or 2 passes. What I want to talk about here is actually the Thunder's defense. When I wrote about the Mavericks a few days ago, I mentioned that there are two small-ball teams whose defense has not collapsed this season. One is the Heat and the other is the Thunder. The Thunder's defensive efficiency ranks 11th in the league. In fact, looking at the absolute value of defensive efficiency, they are not too far ahead of the mid-range teams behind them, but it is commendable that young people can achieve this level. Compared with the conservative and ""restrained"" small ball defense of the Warriors and Mavericks, the Thunder, who have better physical fitness and stronger athletic ability, are more aggressive and more aggressive with the ball. They have bigger holes behind them and at the three-point line and are more dependent on them. Rotate out of your opponent's space and move the ball. Regardless of the injured weirdo insiders, the Thunder's current starting center Jaylin Williams has the gene of dribbling and hitting people in his blood. He has three-pointers and support. He is a modern insider with a high basketball IQ, but After all, the height is not outstanding, so the Thunder are also a team that needs to accumulate numbers to protect the paint area. There are two tricks that work well against the Thunder: one is to change the defense and accurately transfer the ball, coupled with high-quality finishing and fixed-point response. For example, the Clippers in this game; the second is fancy blasting. The Thunder are not tall or strong, and they are a team that defends the ball aggressively and expands their formation, which further weakens rebound protection. In addition, since the leading defender is of a tough build, the Thunder are also more afraid of pull-up scorers. Look at it this way, the Suns and Clippers both have ways to deal with the Thunder. However, the Thunder defeated these two teams in the past week. The Suns are missing Ayton, and the Clippers made an outrageous three-pointer in one game. These are all good reasons for losing, but some of the content of these two games can give us a better understanding of the Thunder, Suns, and Clippers, and evoke some unpleasant memories of the two losing teams - notice, do the young people on the opposite side look like the energetic version of the Mavericks? You can find countless differences between the Thunder and the Mavericks. The differences in the talents and shooters of the two teams' players determine the differences in their respective offensive and defensive systems. However, they have two things that are very close: they both have a five-out lineup; they both have an unsolvable singles player. Due to the uneven quality of shooters, the Thunder's five-out lineup is not as deadly as the playoff version of the Mavericks. But the Thunder guys are not just P.J. Tucker squatting in the corner. They have some ability to score points. Gidi, Dort, and Jaylen have three-point shooting percentages of 32.3%, 33.9%, and 35.1 respectively. %, but they are still the team's second, third, and fourth scorers respectively. If they are in good condition, they may give you a hit. The Thunder are a pain in the ass some nights, they can pull you into their rhythm and go to the lane where they excel. If you don't want to be led by the nose, you have to take advantage of the size advantage of the center when the Thunder's five outsiders are performing well, but this is not easy. The Clippers have this hope. In the battle between the two sides on the 22nd, Zubac played well offensively and defensively. But Lu did not end with Zubac, but instead used the five small players to face the Thunder's five outsiders. There are Morris and Westbrook among these five players, which means that the defense and space are not fully occupied. In addition, George's injury disrupted the plan and mentality. Therefore, in the areas where the Thunder are better at, it is reasonable that the Clippers cannot beat them. The Suns have no hope of using a center to fight back, because they didn't have Ayton in the game on the 20th, and they couldn't pose a threat with Biyombo and Langdale. Therefore, the Suns, who were not good at playing small, were forced to play small with the Thunder. After the game, Monty expressed his dissatisfaction with the whistleblowing, believing that the Thunder got too many free throws and the Suns got too few. Monty's continued voice may improve the Suns' subsequent whistleblowing situation. However, Monty also has to think about whether his Paul + Booker + Shamet + Craig + Wainwright, or Paul + Lee + Rose + Okogie + Bazley, is it right? Too small? Without Ayton's help, the Suns' pick-and-roll was completely unable to threaten the middle, and it was impossible to fully change the Thunder's defensive formation. Jigsaw's attack points are all shooter types, so the only way the Suns can break the game is Booker's pull-up. In this game, Booker scored 46 points and only had 1 assist. The Thunder ate up these 46 points, as well as some running catch-and-shoot jumpers from Shamet and Rose. It was even more painful for him to defend the basket and was relatively safe. . The five minors of the sun are not powerful. The main attacker is not a sudden scorer, especially Paul who has almost no breakthrough threat, which makes their five-out style attack ceiling insufficient. On the defensive end, Paul + Booker are already two defenders. If you want to maintain the top five defense, the other three positions must be forwards. However, the Suns could not muster three forwards at the moment. Monty tried for a long time and finally selected Shamet + Craig + Wainwright to finish. After being repeatedly named and rubbed, they finally relied on zone defense to restrict SGA. The offensive was lost because Wayne Wright missed a key corner three-pointer - another case of dissatisfaction with both defense and space. The Thunder are not yet an opponent that the Suns and Clippers need to consider. The Suns and Clippers also have reason to believe that the problems exposed in those two games are not fatal in most cases. The Suns still have Durant as a card to play. This is a figure who can change the underlying logic of offense and defense. If you can't do tricks now, with Durant, you may be able to do it. However, the Suns still cannot forget the losses they suffered from the five-out lineup. After Durant returns to the team, what specific means will be used to counterattack? The Clippers want more. George's injury left another card open for them in the lineup selection for the decisive battle. Morris seemed to be a cancer that couldn't be cut off. Westbrook was both good and evil. Whether or not to use a center was also a technical problem. The Clippers have almost everything, but they don't have a one-size-fits-all plan to conquer the world. They really need Lu's clear mind. If they meet in the first round, today's content should be useful.

Can we count on him in the playoffs? After the Shandong men's basketball team lost three games in a row, there were rumors that McLemore was laid off. The author learned from the Express Club that McLemore returned to Jinan from Tianjin with the team yesterday to prepare for the next game. Since McLemore joined Shandong in the third stage, he has played in 7 games. Shandong has lost 5 of these 7 games. It seems that Lao Mo is not considered a deputy general. McLemore's average per game statistics so far are as follows, averaging 9.7 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1 assist per game, which is not outstanding. But Lao Mo averages 3 turnovers in 12 minutes per game, ranking 16th in the league. This turnover rate is exaggerated. At the same time, as a shooter-type foreign aid, his 40.9% field goal percentage and 37.9% three-point shooting rate are not qualified. Regardless of statistics, the most important thing for a player is to help the team win. For example, McLemore's NBA teammate Morand averaged 12.5 points per game, which is certainly not outstanding, but his role is to help Liaoning establish a strong defensive system. There is an obvious difference between the two Lao Mo. It is worth mentioning that McLemore’s average plus-minus of -43 per game is considered an exaggeration.

Prince made 8 of 8 shots from the three-point line. Richards scored a double-double and hit a career high in rebounds. , Randall’s 57-point career night set multiple records! Let’s take a look at today’s best lineup. [Backcourt] De'Aaron Fox Energy Value: 43 Combat Value: 54.3 Data: 37 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, 1 steal, 1 turnover. Comments: Fox's three-pointers and mid-range shots tonight were extremely accurate, with no blind spots of firepower. The coverage also allowed him to score a game-high 37 points! Mike Conley Energy value: 28 Combat value: 52.3 Data: 24 points, 4 rebounds, 11 assists, 2 steals, 1 block, 2 turnovers Comments: Conley stepped forward when the team needed him most, and scored 11 assists to perfectly connect the team. , although many of the Timberwolves' main players are absent from this campaign, it doesn't hurt to have Conley in charge! [Frontcourt] Torian Prince Energy value: 16 Combat value: 42 Data: 35 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 turnovers Comments: A perfect shooter! Prince's performance of 8 of 8 three-pointers was perfect. He broke the team's record and also led the team to win a key battle! Nick Richards Energy value: 19 Combat value: 41.9 Data: 14 points, 17 rebounds, 1 assist, 2 blocks Comments: Richards scored a large double-double of 14+17 in 26 minutes of playing, playing a super efficient game At the same time, rebounds also hit a career high!

Randall's 26-point performance in the third quarter also set a new single-quarter scoring record in the history of the Knicks! Best pick of the day: Randall, who broke multiple records, coincided with the best lineup. The backcourt combination of Hardy and Abaji supported the invincible cost-effectiveness. The two inside towers of the Great and Kessler both played well. With a performance worth its weight in gold, you must be the first on today’s list! Tomorrow's Interpretation: [Backcourt] Markelle Fultz Energy Value: 30 Recommended Reason: Tomorrow's game between the Magic and the Wizards will inevitably be another fast-paced scoring battle. It was no problem for Fultz to score 20 points, 10 assists and 3 steals during his return. Jaylen Brown Energy Value: 42 Reason for recommendation: Brown has gradually replaced Tatum as the Green Army's first choice on the offensive end, and Brown's data is indeed very stable. The Kings are strong offensively and weak defensively, and Brown is likely to produce luxurious statistics. Blake Wesley Energy Value: 11 Recommendation Reason: The Spurs will take a large rest tomorrow. Wesley is likely to be the starter and will play for more than 20 minutes. 11 points of energy cannot be lost. [Frontcourt] Domantas Sabonis Energy Value: 46 Reason for recommendation: Sabonis only played 40.9 in combat power today, and Sabonis’ data is likely to rebound in the next game. The Green Army's perimeter defense is tight, and Sabonis's fulcrum role is more obvious. Paul George's energy value: 42 Reason for recommendation: Judging from recent performance on the court, George's physical condition is better than Leonard's, so he takes on more tasks. , and it is easier to produce good data. James Wiseman Energy Value: 11 Recommended Reason: The Pistons cultivate their core, so you won’t lose money by choosing him.",,,,"NBA, football",0,0,0,3/21/23 16:42,Houston Rockets Chinese website super chat,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/006IImxzgy1hc7kn0gkr2j30cs0ob4am.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/006IImxzgy1hc7kndqxmgj30ck0o312n.jpg']",,

4.88E+15,MxNE0v5j8,7299427743,Chief of Machine,"Is Davis better at the fifth position? Graphical analysis of the advantages that Davis playing the five position brings to the Lakers: 1. More inside shots. Davis's jump shot this season is better than at any time after the Lakers won the championship in 2020. His effective field goal percentage outside the restricted area was 40.6%, up from 35.4% over the past two seasons. However, an effective field goal percentage of 40.6% is still not very good. As of Thursday, Davis ranked 269th among 283 players with at least 100 attempts outside the paint (Westbrook ranked 270th). Essentially, Davis remains one of the worst mid- to long-range jump shooters in the league. But Davis is taking fewer jumpers this year than he has in any previous season. This season, 72% of his shots have been completed in the penalty area. This is the highest rate of his career, 62% last season and 54% the season before. With the increase in the number of shots in the penalty area, Davis's free throw rate has also improved dramatically, taking 44.4 free throws per 100 shots, which is the second-highest rate of his career and better than every 100 shots taken in the past two seasons. The 35 free throw attempts in 100 shots were up. More inside shots and more free throws have improved Davis' field goal percentage (57.3%) and true shooting percentage (62.9%). His true shooting percentage ranks 21st among all players averaging more than 25 points per game. Ranked sixth among players. Davis is more efficient now because he's playing more like a post player this season. Davis has only played the 4 position 5% of the time this season. This rate is down from 24% last season and 91% in the 2020-21 season. According to SecondSpectrum tracking data, Davis is now running 45.4 pick-and-rolls per 100 possessions, his highest level in the past six seasons. And his rate of cutting to the basket is 58%, which is the most frequently he has cut to the basket since his second season in the league. On Tuesday in New Orleans, Davis blocked 35 picks in 33 minutes and made 21 cuts. The Lakers' first possession looked designed for Davis, but he eventually handed the ball to Russell, cut inside to the basket, caught the ball hard between two defenders, scored and scored. A foul was caused...Davis could also have called it himself via a fake handoff. Speed is his biggest advantage as a center. Late in the first quarter, he pretended to pass the ball to Malik Beasley and bypassed Valanciunas to complete a dunk. 2. Offensive rebounds In addition to career-high field goal percentage and true shooting percentage, Davis also achieved a career-high offensive rebound rate of 9.9%. He may not always get that cutback, but he can block defenders and get in position, and he can steal second-chance opportunities. The Lakers rank 18th in the league in secondary scoring with an average of 14.0 points per game, but Davis's personal secondary scoring is the most in the league, averaging 4.7 points per game, far ahead of second place Randall's 3.9 points 3. Inward cut The appeal after Davis cuts to the basket is not just to complete shots in the paint. At the same time, his cutting inside will also break up the opponent's defense and create openings for his teammates. After cutting inside, he can receive the ball and distribute the ball to the open teammates on the outside. Or teammates can get open without touching the ball at all. When playing with an attacker like James or a non-shooter like Vanderbilt. It would be nice if Davis could shoot like he did in the 2020 playoffs, when he shot 57-of-115 from mid-range (49.6%) and 23-of-60 from three-point range (38.3%). But if his outside shooting touch is not good, at least his outside shooting rate has dropped a lot now. 4. The defensive advantage of the fifth position. Of course, Davis's biggest impact on the team is on the defensive end. Since the All-Star break, the Lakers have ranked first in the league on defense (109.6 points allowed per 100 possessions) and 12th in the league for the entire season. This season, they allowed 108.9 points per 100 possessions with Davis on the court, which is 6.3 fewer points than the 115.2 points they allowed without Davis on the court. Among all players who have played at least 1,000 minutes, Davis ranks second only to Jaren Jackson Jr. in defensive difference between on and off the court. According to SecondSpectrum's tracking data, opponents shot just 43.9% when defended by Davis, and they shot 50.5% of those shots when defended by others. Among the 182 players who have defended at least 500 opponents' shots this season, Davis ranks second behind Antetokounmpo in the difference in opponent's field goal percentage. The Lakers are 8-8 in games played without James (5-5 since the trade deadline), allowing just 110.6 points per 100 possessions in those 16 games. Without back-to-back games until the final week of the season, the Lakers should have Davis on the court for at least the next eight games. Tomorrow the Lakers will face their first opponent in five consecutive home games, facing the Dallas Mavericks, who have 35 wins and 35 losses and are ranked eighth. These next games will be the real test for the Lakers. #lone Rangers vs. Lakers##James##nbaTucaoConference#",,,,"Mavericks vs. Lakers, LeBron James, NBA Tucao Conference",0,0,3,3/18/23 8:20,I'm a James fan.,"['https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/007XZEBxly1hc3pakqrtij30u01hcaod.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/007XZEBxly1hc3pal4ph9j30n00slqb0.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/ 007XZEBxly1hc3pak4w95j30t00ifdkf.jpg']",,
4.88E+15,MxK2Y540K,7479120761,Just love little heat,"What's behind the Heat's best offense this season? 'We started to really connect' By Chiang When the Miami Heat coaching staff decided to make changes to the offense last summer, the hope was that the changes would produce a style built for playoff success. After all, the Heat's offense failed in last season's playoffs despite ranking 12th in the NBA in scoring at 113 points per 100 possessions during the regular season. Miami scored just 105.1 points per 100 possessions in last season's Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, but they lost seven games. So Erik Spoelstra and his staff went to work last offseason to revamp the offense around the strengths of the Heat's best players, especially in the halfcourt when the game slowed down. The changes resulted in more pick-and-rolls with the duo of Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro, more isolations with Jimmy Butler and Adebayo, more post-ups with Butler and the team's top Three-point shooters pass the ball less. Judging from the fact that Adebayo, Butler and Herro are all having arguably the best offensive seasons of their careers, the Heat's offensive changes are effective. However, the team's performance was very lackluster, as the Heat entered Friday with the fifth-worst offensive rating in the NBA this season (111.6 points per 100 possessions). But with just three weeks left in the regular season, the Heat's offense is finally producing positive results for the first time this season. While this ongoing stretch only spans the past eight games, during that time the unit has been able to post the NBA's third-best offensive rating (119.9 points per 100 possessions). ""Boy, this took a long time,"" Spoelstra said of the recent offensive surge as the Heat begin a quick but important two-game trip Saturday against the Chicago Bulls at the United Center. .""Sometimes what you hope or think might happen doesn't happen and you just have to figure it out and you have to hone in. It's ultimately about winning. ""While the Heat's defense has taken a step back recently after entering the All-Star break as the fifth-most efficient unit in the NBA, there are still more wins than losses due to offense. In these eight games, Miami is 5 Win-3, despite ranking 24th in the league in defensive efficiency during that stretch. ""Throughout the first 45 games of the year, we knew how we were going to win games, and that was playing at an incredibly high level. Defense, keep the game close, let our closers finish the game,"" Spoelstra said. ""But we've been working hard on our offense, getting the ball where it needs to go, making sure we have the right Shot contouring, getting into our advantage areas more often, especially in those clutch moments and skirmishes, we can continue to do that. We're finally showing some improvement now and we've got a lot of healthier bodies over the last eight or nine games. ""More healthy bodies will definitely help, as the Heat have been healthy all season long. Miami has missed the most games due to injury this season (268), according to the data, but center Cody Zeller is The Heat's only injured player is expected to return in the coming days after undergoing surgery for a broken nose. However, the two biggest reasons for the Heat's recent offensive uptick are shooting and the outstanding performance of Jimmy Butler. Ben Miami has the fourth-worst team three-point shooting percentage in the NBA this season at 33.9 percent. Over the past eight games, the Heat are shooting 40.9 percent from three, the second-best team in the league. Miami has also become much more efficient on what is considered the least efficient shot in basketball, the long two-point shot. This season, the Heat are making 38.4 non-shooting two-pointers on 9.9 attempts per game. %, while in the past eight games, the shooting rate was 48.4% with 7.8 such shots per game. In these eight games, the Heat's shot chart has not changed significantly, and the shot quality indicator has only improved slightly. But more shots are just going in. It's the positive return the Heat have been hoping for, as they ended last regular season as the NBA's most efficient 3-point shooting team and have brought back nearly the exact same thing this season. roster. ""We know what we're capable of and that's what makes this year so frustrating,"" Herro said. ""We know what we're capable of and we have the talent in this locker room to compete with anybody."" It’s just about hard work and stuff like that. ""Butler's recent confidence is the catalyst behind it all, as he's playing some of the best basketball of his career after the All-Star break. Over his past eight games, he's averaging 27.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 1.6 steals while shooting 55.6 percent from the field, 6 of 14 from 3-point range (42.9 percent), and 88.4 percent from the free throw line on 11.9 attempts per game. Prior to these eight games, Butler was In his first 48 appearances this season, he averaged 21.8 points per game, shot 52% from the field, 78-of-25 three-pointers (32.1%), and shot 84.5% from the free throw line on 8.1 attempts per game. Butler has been shooting 84.5% from the line recently. The extra attempts at the line have allowed the Heat to have the second-highest free throw rate in the NBA through eight games, with 31.5 attempts per 100 attempts, which is better than its season average of 22.8 attempts per 100 attempts. Significant improvement. Those extra points have helped improve Miami's offensive numbers over the past two weeks. ""He's been doing this since the All-Star break and we need every bit of it,"" Spoelstra said of Bart Le said of his recent performance. ""He won't take his foot off the pedal and none of us want him to have any pushback. He had to go, go, go. ""The Heat have shot 40 percent or better from beyond the arc in six of their past 10 games, compared to just seven of their first 61 games this season. The Heat The two best single-game offensive ratings this season (135.3 points per 100 possessions in Wednesday's win over the Memphis Grizzlies and 132.7 points per 100 possessions in a March 6 win over the Atlanta Hawks) both came in the past six games. What you get in the game."" When asked what's different about the Heat's offense lately, Spoelstra said, ""Just more purpose, more in our zone, being consistent in that regard, And in our shooting situation. ""We got our paint attack, got to the free throw line, got more rebound attempts, more confidence, the ball is finding where it needs to go more often. And then those extra passes are used for three-pointers. This goes hand in hand for us. ""The Heat's offensive resurgence fuels optimism that with just 11 regular-season games remaining, the team has finally discovered a winning formula just in time for the playoffs. Is this latest stretch an exception or is it Real improvement will be determined in the coming weeks. Miami was ranked seventh in the Eastern Conference on Friday and is trying to become a top-six seed to avoid qualifying through the playoff race. ""Our There's a lot more scoring,"" Adebayo said. ""There are some games, man, that feel like '90s basketball. At the end of Game 4, it would be 86-89. But now we're putting points on the board, so you just want to keep it that way. I feel like everyone is in a good rhythm now and we're starting to flow and I feel like we're starting to really connect.

Today, the Hawks officially announced that the team officially signed a contract with guard Bogdan Bogdanovic. Completed the contract extension.

According to team policy, the two parties’ Contract details have not been released yet.

The Serbian men's basketball marksman is an important outside shot for the Eagles. Since Bogdanovic is currently focused on helping the Hawks reach the playoffs, the contract extension was negotiated between his agent and Hawks general manager Landry Fields this week, and was eventually reached by both parties. . Bogdanovic was poached from the Kings by the Hawks in the summer of 2020 with a four-year, $72 million contract. At that time, the past that was determined to rebuild did not match this offer, so Bogdan was a restricted free agent. Norwich successfully traveled east. During his three years with the Hawks, Bogdanovic has been one of the team's most stable starters and outside shooting spots. The 30-year-old Bogdanovic also averaged 14.2 points, 3.4 rebounds and 3.3 assists in six seasons with the Kings and Hawks. The level is quite stable, and the Eagles currently have a record of 34 wins and 35 losses this season, ranking 8th in the Eastern Conference, and are in good shape to advance to the playoffs.

4.88E+15,Mxmo4zHPT,7479120761,Just love little heat,"Tyler Herro continues to deliver for Heat — even as tough shooting night comes to an end Made one of the most important shots of the game. ""That's part of Taylor's greatness, he doesn't let previous mistakes or mistakes or anything affect his confidence or self-belief,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Close games, critical games, critical moments, he's fearless."" With the Heat trailing by two points, Herro received a pass from Jimmy Butler, dribbled to his right and toward his defense. The player threw a fake shoulder to create space. Herro took advantage of the space and hit a step-back three-pointer with 4 seconds left on the game clock, giving the Heat a two-point lead with 55.3 seconds left in the fourth quarter and chasing the much-needed 119 points. -115 against the Utah Jazz on Monday night at Miami-Dade Arena. Prior to that crucial shot - his final shot of the game - Herro had made 4 of 15 shots from the field and 1 of 9 from 3-point range. After that clutch shot, the Heat never trailed again as the three-point shot proved to be the game-winner. Herro ended Monday's win with 18 points, six rebounds and two assists while shooting 5-for-16 from the field (31.3%), 2-for-10 from 3-point range (20%) and 6-for-6 from the free throw line. ""I make the same shot every time,"" Herro said as the Heat wrap up a quick two-game homestand against the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday. ""Sometimes they go in, sometimes they don't. That's part of basketball, you have to be mentally prepared. If the shot doesn't fall, then you have to be mentally strong enough to take that shot at the end of the game and make it. ."" The 23-year-old Herro has proven that this season. In single possessions with less than a minute in the fourth quarter or overtime, Herro is an efficient 8-for-14 (57.1%) from the field and 4-for-8 (50%) from 3-point range this season. Made 7 free throws. Jimmy Butler is the only Heat player to score more than Herro in such situations this season, with 34 points. Looking around the NBA, Sacramento’s De’Aaron Fox (40 points), Dallas’ Luka Doncic (35 points), Atlanta’s Trae Young (31 points) and Butler have scored in this situation this season. A player above Herro. Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton tied Herro with 27 points. ""A lot of people are going for 1-for-9, but they're not going to take the last shot,"" Herro continued. ""Some people might say it's a bad shot. But no matter what shot I'm on the court, I'm going to stay confident and shoot it. I don't care. I'm going to shoot, shoot, shoot, that's what I do."" That's what I do. The mentality Spoelstra wants Herro to have, especially behind the arc, as opposing defenses continue to try to keep him out of the paint. Herro averaged 8.1 three-pointers per game this season, shooting 37.6% from the field, a career high. ""If I have any complaints, it's not about his three-point shooting. I wish he could shoot three or four more,"" Spoelstra said. ""I thought he got 10 [Monday], but I think he has a chance to get three or four more. He's a very accurate shooter. If he can find different ways off the ball to finish off screens, pass the ball and coverage. I think everyone is plotting him so hard to keep him out of the paint and limit his ability to make plays, which can be a great equalizer, but not everyone has the kind of weapons that he has . “When he shoots open threes, the whole team and the head coach expects him to take advantage of those opportunities. ""Where's the defense? The Heat's defense was decent in Monday's win over the Jazz, but it has been below average since the All-Star break. The Heat finished with the fifth-best defensive rating in the NBA (per 111.2 points allowed per 100 possessions) heading into the All-Star break. Through 11 games after the break, the Heat ranked 22nd in the league in defensive efficiency (117 points allowed per 100 possessions). The Heat’s half-court defense took a step back, Ranked 11th in the league entering the break, but only 19th in the 11 games since. Miami has also allowed more second chances and transition points since the break. ""If we really want to do something, Really want to make some noise, let's keep the offense the way it is and let's get the defense up to par,"" Butler said.

These three people are the biggest contributors: The first contributor: dominant offense and defense. Anthony Davis was in the last game.

4.88E+15,MxhVECOhE,6271375253,PaytonFu,"#ncaaCrazyMarch#🏀Opening Game🙌Tomorrow morning at 9:10, I will partner with @Alan Xueyang to commentate on the FirstFour matchup between the University of Pittsburgh Panthers vs. the Mississippi State Bulldogs at @iQIYI Sports! The winner of this game will advance to the round of 64 to challenge the Iowa State Cyclones, the No. 6 seed in the Midwest Division and the Big 12 defensive powerhouse. Without further ado, here’s the preview of #futalks#! In college basketball in March, there will always be teams with completely different styles going head-to-head. This is a classic example: Mississippi State is one of the toughest defensive teams in the SEC and even in the country. The Bulldogs only allow 61 points per game (National 10th), averaging only 39.4% opponent shooting per game (10th in the nation), and averaging 8.8 steals per game (19th in the nation). In his first year on the job, Chris Janes built the team into a blue-collar team with aggressive defense and strong confrontation, proving that his previous success at New Mexico State (four WAC regular season championships) was no accident. Senior center Tolu Smith is the core of Mississippi State. The 6-foot-11 big man averages 15.8 points, 8.5 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game. He plays the role of offensive initiator in the low post most of the time. Whether it's his strong post-up play, his aggressive second-chance scoring, or his ability to find his teammates when double-teamed, Tolu always makes his opponents dare not relax on the court. The Bulldogs performed well in the final stage of the regular season, defeating strong teams such as TCU (No. 11 in the United States), Kentucky, and Texas A&M (No. 25 in the United States), making the committee look at themselves and getting a ticket to the championship. However, this team also has very obvious shortcomings: poor shooting (the team's three-point shooting rate is 26.6%), resulting in crowded offensive space. The team's best ""shooter"" Dashawn Davis' three-point shooting percentage is less than 35%, and the main point guard Shaqir Moore often enjoys the treatment of being left 2-3 steps behind the three-point line. Once Tolu is double-teamed in the low post and unable to deliver the ball in time, or falls into a foul crisis, the Bulldogs' positional warfare offense will become ugly. In addition, although they are good at double-teaming the opponent's strong points and creating turnovers, Mississippi State's rotation is often disrupted when encountering opponents with superior athletic ability and excellent shooting. Moreover, they are easily swayed by shooting fakes and fail to change defense in time when guarding pick-and-rolls. These are also bad habits that will be targeted. And it plays right into the University of Pittsburgh's hands: the Panthers rank among the top three in the ACC in three-point attempts, field goals made and field goal percentage. They have four players averaging double figures and all are experienced upperclassmen. The 6-foot-7 Blake Hinson shot over 38% from three-point range and was the team's rebounding leader. He moves aggressively off the ball and has NBA-level shooting range, and enjoys playing pick-and-pop pick-and-rolls with Jamarius Burton and Nellie Cummins. Both Burton and Cummins have excellent vision (both average more than 4 assists per game, top ten in the ACC) and are a combo guard combination that cannot be underestimated. Greg Elliott, who transferred to the team from Marquette University (Wade's alma mater), has a terrifying wingspan (nearly 7 feet) and is a typical 3D weapon (shooting 42% from three-point range). In his fifth season since taking over the team, former K favorite Jeff Capel finally had a winning percentage of over 50% for the first time, bringing one of the worst teams in the ACC over the years out of the quagmire and winning the championship this season. Best coach in the ACC. Pitt is one of the best teams in the country at outside shooting + pick-and-roll scoring. It was once on the Associated Press's top 25 list. It definitely has Cinderella potential. However, after the main center Federico was injured in the ACC Championship, Pitt's interior defense has a lot of hidden dangers: the 6-foot-11 Finnish national youth team member averaged 1.7 blocks per game, ranking third in the ACC. He provides critical rim protection for Pitt, which has mediocre defense and is not good at hand-to-hand combat. If he is unable to play, the Spanish freshman twins Diaz-Graham may have to face Tolu directly. Both Jorge and Guillermo are 7-foot tall and thin long-range shooters. Although their wingspan and bounce speed are good, they will suffer greatly from physical confrontation. If this game slows down, Pitt is likely to struggle and be overwhelmed by Mississippi State's meat grinder style of play. TheDanceIsHere💃Finally, let me give you a set of metaphysical data. Since the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship began to adopt the FirstFour format, 10 of the 11 Mad Three tournaments have had at least one team that barely made it to the top 32. No one will forget the magical journey of VCU in 2011 and UCLA in 2021 to reach the final four. Perhaps this year's ultimate dark horse is from the final four!

It is still a bit cumbersome to use ""career average of 17.7 field goals and 8.4 field goals per game, including 9 three-pointers, 3.8 field goals, 4.3 free throws, and 3.9 free throws. Career three-point percentage, 43%, free throw rate, 91%, true shooting percentage, 63%."" Advanced data experts have given a ShootingQuality to judge a player's comprehensive shooting ability. ((Spacingx2)+((StandardizedPaddedFT%+StandardizedPadded3P%)x5))/7*Spacing=(3PA*(((3P%*1.5)*1.5)-0.535)) According to this formula, the most retired players in the NBA Quasi-marksman: Ray Allen, Nash, Peja, Price, Chauncey, Miller, Barry, Hawkins, Dirk, Granger, Rice, Hornacek, Terry, Richmond , Reed, Bird (he was somewhat lowered because he did not have enough three-point shooting samples early), Mullin (the same as Bird)... If you admit that the above list looks reliable. , then it proves that this shot quality formula is also OK, right? For example, according to this shooting formula, in the 2014-15 season, Klay Thompson reached the peak of his career and was the 23rd best shooting season in NBA history: that is quite good. The 22nd place is Nash in 2008, and the 25th place is Ray Allen in 2012. Lillard's best shooting season is 2021, ranking 32nd in history. In NBA history since 1978, the five individual seasons with the best shooting performance are: Curry in 2016, Curry in 2019, Curry in 2021, Curry in 2015, and Curry in 2018. The sixth place is Korver in 2015: That year, Korver made it to the only All-Star Game in his career, shooting 49% from three-point range, and his field goal percentage from 3 feet away was: 23 short and mid-range shots. %, 43% in mid-range shots, 45% in long mid-range shots, and 49% in three-point range. The seventh place is Curry in 2013. The eighth place is Cole in 1996 - the same Cole who won 72 games with the Bulls and had a three-point rate of 51%. Then came the peak seasons of Dunloe, Redick, Peja, Kapono, and Nash. That is: Curry has captured the top five best shooting seasons in NBA history, six of the first seven shooting seasons, and ten of the top 20 shooting seasons. Klay's best shooting season of his career is already the 23rd best shooting season of all time - but not as good as Curry's 10th best shooting season of his career. The last story, told by Seth Curry. When Del Curry was with the Toronto Raptors, he would take his son to practice. At that time, Stephen could beat the Raptors players with fixed-point shooting. Seth named him and said that at that time, the Raptors were competing with Stephen in shooting, including Carter, McGrady, and Bugs Bogues.

Sometimes, even players who have won multiple scoring titles and possess a ""kaleidoscope"" of offensive methods will have moments where they ""fail"", or even fail to score 10 points in a game. It's hard to get. Below we list four good scorers, including Curry and Jordan. Let's take a look at how many times they scored less than 10 points in a single game and some of the reasons. As the top three-point shooter in history, Curry has played 50 games. His performance has always been very stable, but this was after he became famous. His fame should have been when the Splash Brothers became popular in the 14-15 season. Before that, His performance has not been known too much by the outside world, and Curry suffered from ankle injuries in the early stages of his career. In addition, his body was thin, so he was not favored and important for a time.

The Black Mamba, with his strong heart, could always hit a winning shot as steady as an old dog. How many basketball teenagers have become inspirational chicken soup in Los Angeles at four in the morning? Kobe, whose textbook style of play was highly entertaining and extremely popular in China, became my idol when I was studying. After the plane crash, I never watched the NBA again. The picturesque beauty is forever hidden in my heart, frozen along with the memory. The Kobe I once chased and the girls I once chased were gone forever as time went by. People who know me well should know that I am a very nostalgic person. Thinking of the past so vividly, I can't help but feel sad and sad several times. But the reality is cruel. The gradually fading age tells me that I don’t and cannot be so pretentious anymore! It wasn't until I got out into society that I really started to become crazy about basketball. I never expected that my favorite star right now is actually Curry, the top shooter. Why don't you like the mighty and sturdy James? Maybe it's because my dream of dunking that I almost could dunk hasn't come true for a long time, so I should give up the fantasy of dunking... Then why do I like this stupid-looking Stephen? First of all, he has a very good character and has almost no scandals, which shows that he has a strong willpower to resist external temptations and is worth learning from. Some people say that Curry ushered in the small ball era and basketball has become less enjoyable to watch. I don't agree with this. His incredible long-range shooting talent is so dazzling that it masks his excellent dribbling, ball control, passing and other hard skills. Others are his scoring area, and his outrageous and random shots can be collected into highlights. Dare to be so reckless is already a kind of courage that is highly confident in oneself. The first youth belongs to the Laker Kobe, and the second youth belongs to the warrior Curry. He no longer has the energy to chase the third youth. We are all getting old, aren’t we? It's late at night, and I haven't said good night to myself for a long time. The whole world was quiet, except for a weird guy who was about to turn thirty and wearing size 30, still looking at the keys. Curry, my idol, thank you for giving me strength! I will always regard taking confident shots as my lifelong belief, and will continue to practice and become stronger! I hope that in my lifetime, I can go to the US to watch you play in person. I don’t know if you will become a blacksmith by then, or if you will continue your legend. I look forward to it... Regarding this sudden Weibo, I refused to explain.

4.88E+15,Mwj2UuFaz,1808638663,Citizen Uitler,"When it comes to the privilege of high-ranking rookies, the first counterexample that comes to mind is Harden. He was a substitute for the first three years since he entered the industry. You are the third overall pick. According to industry rules, there is no reason to be a substitute, right? So where does his privilege lie? I think it's still positioning. Westbrook was already in his second year at the time and was the team's core point guard and main ball handler. Functionally, there is overlap with Harden, so the Thunder followed Ginobili's approach and positioned Harden as the sixth man from the beginning, as the ball-handler of the second team. This was discussed by the team from the beginning. OK Starting with Westbrook is the Swiss Army Knife Safrosa who is better defensively. Another reason may be that the Thunder was no longer in a rebuilding state the year Harden joined the team. That year they achieved an excellent record of 50-32. It’s no longer the stage to use rookies at will and not worry about their mistakes. So if Harden has special privileges, he only has time guarantee in his rookie year. This is quite an unusual phenomenon for the top three rookies. Someone in a similar situation to him may be Maturin who is walking horses this year. Although he is not that high a top rookie, the 6th pick is not low. In terms of ability, he must be able to start, but from the beginning, the team has positioned him as a substitute scorer. He has only started 6 games so far this season. So the question came to Smith. Why does Smith start? In addition to his halo and body protection, what is more important is his positioning, his defensive potential, and his shooting characteristics, which determine that he should have started from the 3D forward position. The Rockets' No. 4 position was originally No one, there's no positional conflict, all the talk about his positioning, there's never been any doubt at this point. The only problem is that he didn't use his shooting ability. Will this positioning change? I don’t think so, at least not this year. At least I haven't found any rookie who changed his position halfway through the year he entered the industry. If anyone knows, please tell me and everyone knows me. Regarding the use of Smith, you can replace him because he makes a mistake, you can shorten his playing time, you can adjust his rotation order...but if he just can't score...you have to Put him on the bench, or even more extreme, send him to the Development League... Let's not say that there is no such precedent. From a player's point of view, I might have had psychological problems caused by excessive pressure, which made me unable to score goals. However, you sent me to the Development League. This is a signal of distrust, which is much greater. A poor person would get such treatment? Not only will this not relieve his pressure, but it will create greater pressure from public opinion - delegating high-ranking rookies to the Development League? Was Smith ever expected to be the No. 1 pick? All the scars have to be exposed one by one without mentioning them, and the public opinion and traffic have to be repeatedly squeezed. I will definitely compare them one by one, which high-ranking rookies have played in the Development League before... and then compare them one by one. Parallel imports are associated with Smith... and by the way, the Rockets are pushed to the forefront... Player agents don't do it either... No matter from any aspect, there is no reason to engage in such actions... ..Some friends also said that there are not a few fans who support the devolution of Smith...To be honest, I think it is not an exaggeration to say that you are making violent remarks...You have a deplorable intention...There are always many people. None of them are strong evidence to prove that the point of view is correct...but when it comes to violent theories, I want to put one out myself. It can be regarded as private time, you can agree or disagree. If Henderson is selected next year, I suggest that he starts from the bench. The reason is actually the same as Harden's entry. Henderson plays a ball-holding style, his shooting efficiency is not up to standard, and he also has weaknesses in defense. In his rookie year, he is not suitable for starting with Shen Jing and Green. On the contrary, it is more suitable to lead the rotating lineup to kill everyone. If Green is a scorer with and without the ball, then Henderson basically plays a ball-dominant style and must have the ball in his hand. Let him start? It's not appropriate no matter how you think about it. However, if he is selected from the liberal arts class, then Smith's position will indeed be awkward. But even if Wenban and Shin Kyungdu are placed in the starting lineup, this lineup is still awkward. Both need to hold the ball, and neither of them can shoot. If Smith's shooting has not recovered next year, it will be difficult for him to be qualified as a forward. You can't always put There are three non-shooters on the court...then the real sweet trouble will come. KPJ and Green are actually fine, especially KPJ. He can just switch without the ball. He has the foundation. But Smith is a real problem. Even if he becomes 40% of the three-point shooters next year, if he plays 4 offensively and Zebra plays 3, the defense will be reversed? It’s not impossible. But only by playing a real game can we know whether this thing is reliable or not... If you are so confused, you might as well go directly to 3 and choose Miller and be done with it... #HoustonRockets##nbaTucaoConference #",,,,"Houston Rockets, nba complaints conference",2,49,49,3/8/23 12:36,Weibo web version,,,

Beasley and Vanderbilt did not have a high presence in these two games, but when James was on the court, their presence was quite high. These two people can definitely play well under James. Why did he get a bigger contract? Mainly because James has the most organized game. He can sort out the offense and space and keep everyone in a very reasonable place. As long as the role players' interest in playing continues, they can follow James to find the most comfortable way of playing. Beasley can find a gap for three-point shots in the most suitable place. Van Der Biao can clearly defend the opponent's arrows and make contributions. When James is away, the Lakers' style of play becomes chaotic. Everyone does not have a strong sense of being needed on the court. Their positions and running methods are vague. The ball movement is not smooth and correct enough. In many possessions, , everyone’s advantages will be wasted or delayed. The current problem for the Lakers is obvious.

4.87E+15,MvniT3oMO,3901950092,Play ball with rice,"#Thompson#The most significant characteristic of the current era of the NBA league is the small ball era. Three-pointers are still popular throughout the league. As long as you shoot three-pointers accurately enough, you will have the opportunity to gain a foothold in the NBA. The most popular NBA league currently in service He is a marksman and an excellent 3D master. Every year in the playoffs, there are always many 3D players who shine. For example, Payton Jr. last season was very accurate in shooting three-pointers offensively and was very tough defensively. In the past, sharpshooters such as Ray Allen and Korver often had superb three-point performances in the playoffs that year. Who is the strongest three-point shooter in the current NBA league? 54 points + 42 points! First in history! The strongest marksman is reborn, and he truly deserves the four-time crown. The Golden State Warriors are having a very difficult season. On the one hand, there are some problems with the team's lineup, and on the other hand, core injuries such as Curry continue to have problems. Therefore, as the defending champion, the Warriors' record has always fluctuated between sixth and tenth in the Western Conference. Recently, Curry has not returned yet, and Wiggins is absent due to personal reasons. The Warriors almost completely rely on Klay Thompson and Jordan Poole to win. Jordan Poole's shooting is still good and bad, and not stable enough. However, Klay Thompson has been a bit fierce recently: in the last three games, he averaged 32 points + 5 rebounds + 2 assists per game, shooting 56.8% from the field and 54.2% from the three-point range. The Warriors have won two consecutive games recently, and the team's record ranking has also risen to seventh place in the Western Conference. During the days when Curry was recuperating from injury, Klay Thompson undoubtedly became the savior of the Warriors. It was he who exploded wildly, led the team to win the game, maintained the record and ranking, and did not let the ranking drop. This has made Warriors fans Very pleased. I remember that at the beginning of the regular season, Klay Thompson's three-point shooting percentage was very poor, only 27% at one time. At that time, many fans said that Klay Thompson was old and no longer useful. However, as he kept playing, without realizing it, Klay Thompson’s three-point shooting percentage has risen to 40.8% (18th in the league). Moreover, Klay Thompson averaged 4.4 three-pointers per game (the most in the league). ). I have to admit that Tang Shen's three-point shooting ability is now back to the strongest level. According to statistics released by the US media, Klay Thompson has scored 40+ points four times this season, which has reached the best level of his career. In the regular season between the Warriors and the Hawks, Klay Thompson scored 54 points + 8 rebounds + 3 assists + 1 block (10 of 21 three-pointers in a single game), leading the team to win. In the regular season between the Warriors and Thunder, Klay Thompson scored 42 points, 3 rebounds, and 2 assists (12 of 16 three-pointers in a single game). At the beginning of the season, the Warriors played the Rockets, and Klay Thompson scored 41 points, 4 rebounds, and 3 assists (10 of 13 three-pointers in a single game). In the recent regular season between the Warriors and Rockets, Klay Thompson scored 42 points + 7 rebounds + 1 assist (12 of 17 three-pointers in a single game), leading the team to win. The NBA released statistics. When Klay Thompson scored 40+, the Warriors had a record of 18 wins and 0 losses and had never lost. Among all players in NBA history who had 10+ and 40+ games, he was the only one with a winning percentage of 100. %. Klay Thompson has hit 12+ three-pointers multiple times in a single season, becoming the first person in NBA history (NBA experts from US media believe that Klay Thompson is now the strongest three-point shooter in the league. He has been reborn. , reaching another peak). Klay Thompson has made at least 12+ three-pointers in a single game three times in his career, the first record in NBA history. Curry ranks second in history twice, and Kobe, Lillard, Marshall and LaVine each once, tied for third in history. How strong is Tang Shen at his peak? Klay Thompson scored 60 points in just 29 minutes that year (least 60+ points in NBA history). The record for the most three-pointers in a single game in NBA history is still held by Klay Thompson (14 three-pointers in a single game). . The Warriors have reached the finals 6 times in the past 10 years and won the championship 4 times. The Splash Brothers (Curry + Tang Shen) are both well-deserved four-time champions. At the same time, US media NBA experts and reporters believe that Curry and Klay Thompson should be regarded as the strongest backcourt combination in NBA history. Curry has been recovering from his injury for 23 days. His injury situation will be re-evaluated. I hope he can recover soon and return to the game.",,,,thompson,0,1,1,3/2/23 9:36,iPhone 8 Plus,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/e893088cgy1hbl9kouiwdj20ht0ctgto.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/e893088cgy1hbl9ko7yk5j20ht0beagx.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ e893088cgy1hbl9kp65p7j20ht0a1tfh.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/e893088cgy1hbl9kpi1esj20ht0a7n3s.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/e893088cgy1hbl9kqcgp qj20ht0a6te4.jpg', 'https://wx3.sinaimg. cn/large/e893088cgy1hbl9kqrum9j20ht0boq8w.jpg']",,

Everyone's performance in the fourth quarter gave us a chance to win or tie the game. We played defense. One thing we have to do better defensively is fouling. I think they took 40 free throws. If you give a team like that 40 free throws, it's going to be hard to beat them. The other thing is we only made 10 of 20 free throws in the first half. In a scrimmage game, every point counts. We have to do a better job at the free throw line. ——Kidd I don’t think they felt our physicality every possession, and we made some mistakes. We can score 39 points in the third quarter, but we can also lose 38 points in the second quarter and 37 points in the third quarter. This is a very offensive game. The opponent is attacking us. We must be able to Better to disrupt their rhythm. Defensively, we have some improvements to make starting from me, but we gave ourselves a chance to win. We must accept this result. ——Irving I think the guy played well, we will see how his body feels tomorrow. But I think people are excited to see him on both sides of the ball. ——Kidd For Maxi, this is a process. The same goes for the team. We have a new member, Kai is still very new to the environment. We started the game quickly without enough training and improvised during the game. Not just for Maxi, but for the team. ——Kidd Maxi has the ability to help us on the defensive end and also the ability to help us on the offensive end. Because he can shoot threes, he can provide floor space, he can do what Wood does. The minutes aren't necessarily going to be what everyone wants and we have a deep roster, so if we can be unselfish and do our part even off the court, we'll be good. ——Kidd O web link When my fellow countryman first came here, he was a mid-range shooter. His playing style at that time was really more suitable for playing FIBA games, so he had to rebuild his playing style and rely on his defense. He got a chance to play. He started at small forward, which helped us because it helped our defense when Dirk was out there. And his shooting was quickly developed. In less than a year, he became a three-point shooter with a three-point shooting rate of more than 30%. It was only a matter of time before he became a three-point shooter with a shooting rate of more than 40%. He's a unique guy because of his ability to protect the rim. You can ask any statistician, guys who can shoot from long range and protect the rim are extremely valuable in this league. Whatever health issues he has with his hamstring appear to be a thing of the past. ——Carlisle (What birthday gift did you bring to Doncic?) I brought him Haliburton, and his birthday is today too. ——Carlisle Carlisle's first game as an NBA coach was the opening game of the American Airlines Center in 2001. As the head coach of the Pistons, he led the team to Dallas. OWeb link",,,,,0,0,4,3/1/23 16:42,mavschina super talk,['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7ly1hbkg9yhkuwj20xc0m8dnz.jpg'],,
4.87E+15,Mve76ETRB,7479120761,Just love little heat,"Dragic was waived; Lowry will miss his 10th consecutive game. Why the Heat didn't pursue shooting guard Barry. Former Heat point guard Goran Dragic, who started 282 games in parts of seven seasons with Miami, was waived by the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday at the deadline to retain playoff eligibility. hours before the date. Dragic's availability coincides with continued uncertainty about the health of point guard Kyle Lowry, who was ruled out of Wednesday's game against Philadelphia at Miami-Dade Arena because of knee soreness. While the Heat have remained fond of Dragic and would welcome his return, a source close to him said there are other more likely destinations for the veteran point guard at this time because of the Heat's roster. It’s full and there’s no regular playing time during the regular season. Team rotation. Dallas was viewed as a potential landing spot; where he could reunite with friend and fellow Slovenian Luka Doncic. But if Miami loses faith in Lowry's return, the Heat are more likely to go for Dragic, which hasn't happened yet. The Heat remain hopeful Lowry can return, though that could be a week or more away. Because Dragic was waived before March 1, he can sign with any team until April 9 and remain eligible for the playoffs. The Heat have up to 15 players on standard contracts, and signing Dragic or anyone else would require cutting a player, such as Haywood Highsmith or Omar Utson. After working on the field in Philadelphia, Lowry determined his knee wasn't quite ready and he wouldn't play Wednesday. This will be the 10th consecutive game he has missed because of knee soreness, after missing four games in January with the same condition. Erik Spoelstra said the team ""wanted to get him back to normal and get him moving the way he can move."" The Heat are not actively pushing for any point guards available on the buyout market, with a roster that includes Russell Westbrook (signed with the Clippers), Patrick Beverley (Chicago), Reggie Jackson (Denver) and John Wall (still unsigned). Miami also declined to offer its most attractive asset to Brooklyn in Kyrie Irving. So since Gabe Vincent is the only healthy natural point guard on the Heat's roster, why isn't Miami actively pursuing another point guard? Five reasons contributed: ▪The Heat believe Lowry will return from his knee injury quickly and believe the point guard position can be adequately filled by Vincent and Lowry. Even without Lowry, Miami believes it has enough ball handlers, including Vincent, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro and Victor Oladipo. ▪The team liked Vincent's performance. Among all NBA point guards, his defensive field goal percentage ranks among the best in the league. As a starter, his points per game average is average among starters. ▪The Heat believe they need two strong rotation players, not just one. That led to the decision to sign Kevin Love — who was immediately named the starter at power forward — and Cody Zeller, who served as backup center, a position Miami believed needed an upgrade. Both have played well in the Heat's first three games. ▪Miami does not consider any of the available point guards to be must-acquire. The Heat considered Westbrook and did a fair amount of due diligence. But he's a poor 3-point shooter -- already a weakness on the Heat -- and a subpar defender. The Heat sought input on Westbrook from people it trusts, according to people familiar with the matter. One NBA figure respected by the Heat advised industry peers not to sign Westbrook. ▪While the Heat had some interest in Irving (as Dan LeBatard pointed out ), it wasn't unanimous internally and decided not to offer a large asset. At least one person within the Heat organization is opposed to the pursuit because of Irving's baggage and erratic behavior. Another person was more interested, but it never got to the point of actively pursuing Irving before Brooklyn traded him to Dallas.",,,,,0,0,0,3/1/23 10:12,Weibo web version,,,

4.87E+15,MuZqDnNW9,7474258566,MagicRubikYang,"""The Miracle of Big D City - Dawn in the Bloody Battle"" has been two years ago. It is estimated that many people still remember the game in Figure 8, the second battle between the Lakers and the Thunder. The Lakers faced the absence of Lao Zhan in two consecutive games. They lost all of them to the Thunder, including a humiliating game in which a 26-point lead was overturned. Times have changed, and now the Lakers are finally not the team that has been reversed. Since the rookie’s debut against Golden State on February 12 after the trade, the new version of the Lakers has achieved a good record of 4 wins and 1 loss in five games (including the one that just completed A wave of three consecutive victories), James played 3 games and maintained a 100% winning rate. A month ago, would you dare to think that this was the Lakers? First of all, compared to the two mid-tier teams, the Warriors and Pelicans, the Mavericks, who are already strong teams, have become even more powerful after trading for Irving. Moreover, this game is an away game. The Lakers also injured their main point guard Russell. With the tradition of low winning percentage in early morning games over the years, I thought about the possibility of the Lakers winning with a small probability, but this big reversal was completely unexpected. I originally set the alarm clock for 5:50 in the morning. I calculated the approximate time to watch the second half, but I don’t know if it was because of the telepathy with the Lakers and James, but I actually woke up at 4:20 for a short while. Not fully awake, I fell back asleep. This is not the first time this has happened because I can’t adapt to getting up early in the morning (although I usually like watching football, I don’t get up to watch football very often in the middle of the night, unless it’s a particularly important game; the World Cup at the end of last year was It was the first time that I got up in the middle of the night to watch football for a period of time), so I got up at 5:50 and adjusted the equipment for watching football in bed and fell asleep again while waiting. It was already around 6:20 when I woke up again, not long after the third quarter started, so I just started watching from here. At that time, I only remembered that the Lakers were about 10 points behind, but after reading the news, I learned that the Lakers were trailing by as much as 27 points in the first half. I was honestly quite confused at the time, wondering if the new version of the Mavericks' ""five-way lineup"" was hitting again. Is this the key point for the Lakers (the only game the new version of the Lakers lost was against the Blazers who hit a super explosive three-pointer. The Lakers currently lack perimeter defensive resources and it is really a problem to deal with strong shooting teams)? I originally planned to watch the last half of the fourth quarter after sleeping for another half hour. But then I thought about it, since the 27-point score difference can be narrowed to about 10 points, wouldn't it be a pity to miss the live broadcast if we catch up with the score gap and finally reach the decisive moment? In the end, as I expected, the Lakers completed this shocking reversal. This is the first time in the league this season that a team has come back to win after being 27 points behind. If you include the 3 points in the final victory, Inside and out, the Lakers won by as many as 30 points after trailing by 27 points. The old rule is to ""reward based on merit"", and the level of merit is obvious: Special Merit: Sakuragi🌸Hua Biao-Vanderbilt Since the Lakers' career first game against Golden State, Vanderbilt has been silent on the offensive end for 3 games. , although the role of the defensive end is still indispensable, the dazzling performance on the offensive end is the key to attracting fans. Then there is today's ""second-generation Rodman"" who can be called a career classic. As we all know, Rodman was once the core and one of the biggest contributors to the Pistons' ""Bad Boys"" and ""Bulls Dynasty"" championships. , and his characteristics that resemble Sakuragi Hanamichi are also talked about. It just so happens that our Lakers have a modern version of ""Sakura Hua Biao"". Van Der Biao does not have Rodman's body and physical fitness, but he is faster and taller than him. Fan Derbiao's performance today made all the audience and even the opponent fans applaud: 15 points, 17 rebounds and 4 steals, a ""double 15+"" efficient data. 3 of the 4 steals occurred in the third quarter. His consecutive steals were The Lakers launched a second wave of counterattack momentum. After several counterattacks, by the end of the third quarter, the Lakers were only 3 points away from the Mavericks. On the defensive end, Van Der Biao still performed well (17 rebounds, 8 offensive rebounds, 4 steals), and the whole game was very effective in defending Doncic (Doncic only hit 2 of 7 shots in single defense against Van Der Biao). Although it cannot be completely defended (neither of the two Eastern Europeans can be completely defended by one person), the Lakers' strategy for this game is probably that Van Der Biao and Nongmei will defend Doncic, Xiaoli and Xiaohei will defend Irving, and Brown will assist. (Doncic’s field goal percentage of 45% is far lower than his 50% efficiency, and he made 14 shots from the three-point line. 6), for such a league's first supernova, Van Der Biao's defense is already commendable. First Class Merit: ""Wolf Version Contractor"" - Why is Davis called ""Wolf Version Contractor""? In fact, this nickname involves two NBA players who look very similar to thick eyebrows - Adu and Wolf King (their names) Both are called Kevin, and their last names also contain the character ""特""). I have always believed that the characteristics of thick eyebrows are very similar to a ""defensive version"" of Durant, with excellent mid-range shooting, full offensive firepower, tall body without losing speed and delicate skills. In other words, the thick eyebrows can be compared to his draft template - Kevin Garnett. The thick eyebrows do not have the physical fitness and durability of the Wolf King, but they have more delicate skills than the Wolf King. His versatility is not as good as the Wolf King, but The impact on the team is no less than that of the Wolf King. The thick eyebrows on the field attracted a lot of criticism for his lack of enthusiasm on the offensive end, but a superstar is a superstar - I can find your place in the next game. In this game, the thick eyebrow played in 36 minutes and scored 30 points, 15 rebounds and 3 blocks in 36 minutes on 12 of 20 shots. He almost destroyed the Mavericks' inside line on both offense and defense. What is meant by ""those who are faster than him are not as tall as him, and those who are taller than him are not as fast as him""? When you use a forward or defender to defend a thick eyebrow, it is in vain - even if you can keep up with his speed, he can still be on top of you. Random shooting, when you use a big center to guard thick eyebrows, you will be fooled again - with a few steps and turns, you can easily pass the defender and attack the basket, or throw away the inside player and easily make a mid-range shot (this game with thick eyebrows) 7 of 10 shots), including the mid-range shot against Doncic in the last ten seconds of the game that sealed the victory. On the offensive end, the thick-browed eyebrows were unstoppable and on the defensive end, they also spared no effort to contribute energy. Several key blocks were the opponent's strong attacks on the basket. With such a ""small ball inside answer"", are you still worried about not being able to beat the opponent's inside? Second-class merit: James and Schroeder James really worked too hard today. His foot injury recurred and he couldn't get out of the firing line, which really scared James. Although the state was not good in the first three quarters, which may be due to injuries, the fourth quarter was still the same ""little emperor"". At the beginning of the fourth quarter, a three-pointer helped the Lakers even the 27-point difference. He made 5 of 9 shots and won the game without any danger. I hope the foot injury is not serious. Health is the most important thing. Xiaohei mentioned today that the starting lineup continued his previous good form. Even though Lao Zhan was still injured, he helped Lao Zhan share the important task of ball control and organization, and sent 8 assists to connect the team. Apart from the cold touch on the outside, there were basically no obvious abnormalities. The two free throws at the last moment were also a perfect reflection of his ""big heart"". Third class merit: Reeves, Brown. Xiaoli today is really a bit domineering and arrogant. In the past, Xiaoli's impression in my mind was that of a sunny and handsome boy in the Lakers. But today, he got into a verbal argument with Josh Green, who was opposite him. Got blown to a T. It's really rare to see Xiaoli get angry. It seems that he really got into trouble with Josh Green today. Yes, Green did perform very well today, hitting 3 of 5 three-pointers against Xiaoli (Xiaoli was often sent by the Lakers to guard the opponent's core defender), but Xiaoli's performance was not bad either. In the fourth quarter The key three-pointer directly stopped the Mavericks. Seeing the Lakers take the lead again, Xiaoli unleashed his anger on Green, as if he was also a trash talk king. Although Brown is far less impressive than Xiaoli on the offensive end today, his constant defense and interference with Doncic and Irving on the defensive end has also greatly reduced the defensive pressure of Van Der Biao, Nongmei, Xiaoli and Xiaohei. Black List List: 1. Beasley. In fact, it is a bit unfair to put Beasley on the black list today. Although he made only 2 of 11 three-pointers in the game, he is still the only shooter in the Lakers lineup who can control the top space in the NBA. Even if His three-point shooting percentage today is less than 20%, but as long as he is on the court, there must be at least one opponent's defender responsible for marking him. If he catches the ball and prepares to take a shot, he may even face a double-team scenario. This is the Lakers' shooter in the past two seasons. Features that are difficult to possess. Although instability is also his label🏷️, I still hope that he can try to change this shortcoming. The Lakers need this kind of sharpshooting now and in the future. 2. Walker, Bamba, Hachimura. The reason why these three people are mentioned together is that they are currently the players in the Lakers lineup who are eager to improve in the mid-to-high-end games. Among them, Walker has fallen out of the rotation and has not played for a long time to adapt to the situation of poor performance in the game. Excusable. But the other two are also constantly adjusting. They performed well against the two mid-range teams before, but today they seemed a little overwhelmed against the high-level Mavericks. If the Lakers enter the playoffs with their current lineup, then with the Lakers' tactical characteristics, they will definitely not risk a 10-man rotation in the playoffs. If it is shortened to the more common 8-man rotation, then the rotation positions of Hachimura and Bamba will It's more dangerous. It is extremely difficult to win this big comeback. This is also the first game of three away games in five days and a key game in the qualifying round. From Lao Zhan's injury and the team's hard work of not giving up chasing points, we can see how powerful the Lakers are. Longing for victory in this bloody battle, hard work paid off, and in the end we saw the dawn of victory. The next opponent is the Grizzlies, who are second in the Western Conference. The probability of winning is very slim. Although Lao Zhan does not know the extent of his injury for the time being, health is always more important than the record. Besides, he may not be 100% able to return in the next game. It’s not impossible for the Bear to let this game go. He can take good care of himself and get revenge on the Thunder.

4.87E+15,MuO6ZBFWH,5206219510,Souchong experience 12138,"[First, two questions: Westbrook’s Clippers debut of 17+14 was a redemption? It’s hard to prove 780,000 to prove 47 million] Although Westbrook’s Clippers career started quite smoothly, and his double-double score of 17+14 is enough to be justified. Even if he failed to get a good start, his performance on the court was not enough for a player who only received a basic salary of 780,000. For veterans, they are already low-paid and high-powered. Before the game was over, some irrational fans once again targeted Westbrook's old club, the Lakers. Did the former MVP and all-time triple-double king who had the worst performance of his career with the Lakers find redemption with the same city Clippers? You know, the Lakers and Clippers had different expectations for Westbrook from the beginning. For the Lakers, you are the absolute core that we spent 47 million and a large part of the team in exchange for in the future. You are the best ball-holding point next to James, who is very old! It is the strongest engine to support Anthony Davis's internal upheaval! He is the top giant who holds the title of triple-double king and MVP in history! To make your team's already precarious salary space even worse, the Lakers, from the management and players to the fans, are all looking forward to you evolving again with the Lakers and ushering in another peak of your career! but? As your Lakers career has remained healthy, your shortcomings have become more obvious. Your shooting, which was already low in shooting percentage, has become even more precarious. When James and Davis have traded the risk of injury time and time again for a few offensive opportunities. There were repeated low-level mistakes and irrational offensive choices, which wasted the efforts of the entire team. At this time, you start to complain that LeBron James has usurped your ball rights, you start to complain that the team's lineup is deformed and cannot be equipped with excellent shooters, you start to complain about Anthony Davis's glass attributes, and you even point the finger at the management. After the dismissal of champion coach Vogel, the war once again turned to new coach Hamm! Is this a decision made by a top star in NBA history? Is this the performance an MVP-level star should perform? Is this the responsibility shown by a historical triple-double king? I respect Westbrook, I was even obsessed with Westbrook when he was flying in the air during the Thunder period. I am impressed by his development in world peace and his noble personality. I am fascinated by his outstanding violent aesthetics... But this can cover up the court. Performance failure and impact on the performance of the field? If not, then why not discuss the tying three-pointer at the critical moment? Why not discuss teaming up with teammates to win the game? Why not discuss the offensive and defensive integration displayed by the enemy's core players? If you can't, then leave with dignity, stop dreaming about MVP, get the veteran's basic salary of 780,000 yuan, be a role player next to the peak player, and hope to one day reach the level of Ron Harper. , or what the old fish Fisher can achieve. You are just a small role next to FMVP. Who will really care about whether you can turn the tide, and who will care about whether you will harm the team? If you are just a player with a basic salary of 780,000, the Lakers can take Turner and Hield into their pocket. If you are just a player who can only prove yourself in a small team, how can you win the championship? If you are the person who is not expected by anyone, do you still naively think that the basketball you did not shoot in the Lakers can be redeemed in the Clippers? You are nothing more than that. The 38-year-old James is far from the peak of his career, but he is still better than you. Schroeder, who once had no ball to play, may even become a better starting choice than you. In the Lakers, you are one of the three giants that everyone expects. Everyone expects you to lead the team to achieve shocking results. In the Clippers, you just stepped on the lifeboat of the playoffs and became an old spectator who was ridiculed by the Cards fans. I would rather be the head of a chicken than the tail of a phoenix, is it because I can't be the head or the tail of a phoenix? Naive Westbrook fans, do you really think that the current ending is worthy of the wandering young master? Are you satisfied with this? If there is such a day, Westbrook dreams of returning to his peak moment, Kawhi is lost, George is alienated, and the turtle Westbrook descends to earth to lead the team to the top!

4.87E+15,MuMNX1NDK,6450860850,Harden’s power bank,"Let me say a few words. At the beginning of the season, I thought that the main card of this season was depth. The 76ers had a lot of players who could play. I didn’t even discuss trades or reinforcements too much. Although they are not called Galaxy Battleships, for ordinary teams There are already abundant resources. After several high-end games, the main card is still Embiid. We have become a team with only one superstar to support. The other team is playing with the depth of the lineup. Especially in this game, I feel particularly strongly. The substitute period played a dragging role in most games. At the beginning of the season, the substitute firepower was insufficient. Fans called for Maxi to be placed in the sixth man position. Due to some coincidences due to injuries, this goal was achieved. But it doesn't do much. Since the offseason, we have planned to reinforce the interior substitutes for Embiid. After struggling for most of the season, until today, the last person in this position is still Reid. He is indeed not good at it, as he is the rare one in the team. I can't blame River. Sri Lankan people. Tax avoidance traded Thybulle, and many people who could play before were now completely out of the rotation. At the end of the day, it was found that there were not many available, and there was no substitute for the point guard. It all depends on how Maxi plays today. The shooter kept his wife, and Reid was gone in the paint. McDaniels' playing time is much more guaranteed than Seibao's. What I'm happy about is that the extremely demanding fans will find it easy to pick on Embiid after a few high-end games. Unfortunately, there is still a big difference between how good he is alone and how good the 76ers are. At present, it seems that the only way this team can make a difference in the playoffs is that Deng has been messing around in the regular season and will be a Rocket for a month or two in the playoffs. Otherwise, that's it. #Harden##Philadelphia76ers##nbaTucaoConference#",,,,"Harden, Philadelphia 76ers, nba complaint conference",0,33,84,2/26/23 12:41,Harden is super talkative,['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/0072z9AKly1hbgset5fexj30n00rngpb.jpg'],,

Recently, the famous reporter Wen Pang talked about Durant on the show. Wen Pang said that the Warriors would not be able to defeat the 2017 Cavaliers without Durant. Wen Pang said that the Cavaliers in 2017 were very strong. Irving and LeBron were both at their peak, plus the team's three-point shooter. The Cavaliers once achieved a record of 12 wins and 1 loss in the Eastern Conference playoffs, and Wen Pang's point of view was that if the Warriors did not have Durant that year, they would not be able to beat the Cavaliers. Why did Wen Pang say this? The main reason is to question Barkley's point of view. Barkley believes that Durant is not the driver at all, but just one of the passengers on the Warriors bus. Wen Pang said that Durant was not a passenger in the back seat, but Durant was sitting in the passenger seat. Looking back at the Cavaliers War now is more about memories.

4.87E+15,MuHGp2suN,1808638663,Citizen Uitler,"Rockets summer strategy guess, part 2 will first sort out next year's lineup. Seven first-round picks, plus the two who may be drafted, will occupy 9 positions. In addition to Martin, Porter and Tate who are under contract, this will already be 12 spots. There are still three positions left. It is definitely impossible for Xiao Ming to stay. The vacancy in his position will definitely be made available. The other two, Boban and the Knicks, are both in a state of uncertainty. The Knicks have two years of non-guaranteed years. Minimum salary contract, and Boban is a free agent. In other words, theoretically, the Rockets can have 3 positions reserved for reinforcement candidates. The draft is still out of the question, so let’s put it aside for now. Let me first talk about my thoughts on the direction of reinforcement. Quite simply, we need to cast. Regardless of location. We all need projection. Whether you use Shen Jing as the core, or you choose any of Wenban/Henderson, the Rockets need more shooting ability to open up space. Only enough space can help the current and future The players who are about to join will better utilize their strengths. Therefore, when it comes to reinforcements, I will give priority to players with shooting ability. But shooters are generally scarce and often expensive. And most of them have the characteristics of strong offense and weak defense. However, for a junior team like the Rockets, if they require an integrated offense and defense, there will be no such players on the market in the summer. As long as they are better, other teams will compete for them. First of all, this type of player will definitely have no chance with the Rockets. Therefore, when the Rockets select players, even if they are shooters, they should not dislike those players who are seriously biased. Let me give you an example, like Mills of the Nets. He has played less than 500 minutes this season, and his defense has never been good in his entire career. However, his career three-point shooting percentage is 38.9, and this season's three-point shooting percentage is 36.8. The key point is that Mills is on the off-ball side, whether it is hand-off or off-ball coverage. He is one of only 11 players in the league to have a scoring rate of more than 1 per possession. What Shen Jing needs most from teammates is players who are good at off-ball screening and hand-off. With Mills' age and black hole influence on the defensive end, it is unlikely that he will have a place on the playoff team. But he still has a contract of less than 7 million next year. Because the Nets are facing the problem of Huang Zhong's contract renewal, they will still have a lot of tax payment pressure next year... In this case, a space team like Wohuo can be of great help. The Nets will not They may hope to get something else in exchange for Mills, so giving away the Rockets to fill the hole and getting back a TE is a relatively suitable plan for them. Of course, this is just an example. Mills is a player of this type that the Rockets can pick up, but his salary is too small. More than 60 million yuan requires real money. So it doesn't make much sense to take a small contract. Signing a high-paying short-term contract is a solution worth considering. Such as Curidi. Curidi is also one of the 11 people mentioned above. Why is there so much emphasis on off-ball screens and handoffs? Because the Nuggets' Murray is also on this list, and the Kings' Murray, Huerter, Fox, and Barnes don't all meet the standards, but at least one of them ranks among the top in the league. Because of the existence of these players, the offensive capabilities of Sabonis and Teacher Yue can be maximized. Therefore, players with these two skills must be the most suitable choice to match Shen Jing. Curry, on the other hand, has a career three-point shooting percentage of 43.8. He has never been good at defense and is easily targeted in the playoffs. At the age of 30, it is unlikely that he would like to go to a strong team to display his abilities and earn a high salary. I can’t help myself when I get less money. 15 million is not much, but it is a big burden for a team that needs to add shooting and is under tax avoidance pressure. In the same case, the 76ers once did it with Redick. In the season after 28 wins, Redick signed with the 76ers for 23 million a year. Help the team immediately turn around and become a 52-win team. The second year's salary was discounted in half, and he signed for another year. As a player whose functionality and skill points are very similar to Redick, Curridi is a good choice for the Rockets. The point is, this money is still meaningful to fill the salary cap, and this price is not too much to be a substitute. If things go wrong, there will be no pressure to change hands, and you may even earn some other assets. The same is true for Joha. Although his off-ball efficiency will be slightly worse than the above two, his advantage is that he has a slightly better body shape, and he can directly take over as the starting 3 when he comes. You can't blame me for staring at the Nets as a team. They do have a lot of high-quality shooters. It's a pity that they are injured and have to leave. They blow themselves up and can't rely on others. The above analysis focuses on adapting to Shen Jing. Judging from this, Hayward's skill points are obviously inappropriate. His current shot selection is very unsatisfactory, and he has a lot of inaccurate mid-range shots. His three-pointers have continued to decline in the past two years, and his off-ball screen efficiency is very poor. After the handoff, more options are mid-range shots rather than attacking the basket. The point is, his attendance rate is too bad, and the Hornets have no tax pressure. They are a space team and have no urgent motivation to send Hayward away. Here, the second focus that needs attention is the salary status of the counterparty. I mentioned Lowry in the afternoon as a typical case. The Heat are clearly far behind from winning the championship, but the tax payment pressure is real. Dun Luo's contract cannot be moved. The only goal that can alleviate the salary pressure is to move Lowry. Lowry may not be the most suitable player for Shen Jing in terms of skills, but his salary, his experience and temperament, and his ability to lead the team are definitely a suitable complement to the Rockets. The problem I am not sure about is that he is so expensive. Is it appropriate to play as a substitute, and is he willing or not? Usually with this qualification and salary, the unspoken rule is that he must be a starter, even if his ability declines again... In addition, is he willing to be a kid king in the Rockets to help the poor through technology. This is also one of the problems. The wishes of the players themselves are also very important. Although the conditions are right, but people are unwilling to come, there is nothing we can do. It is definitely good for Lu Biao to come to the Rockets as a substitute. He did not perform as expected after recovering from injury this year, but his contract is small, and the Cavaliers do not have to pay taxes. I would rather pick up Fultz for similar skill points, but I just imagined it. VanVleet may join the Magic to squeeze out Fultz's position, but from a skill point of view, Fultz is not the most suitable player for the Rockets. At the same time, the Magic have no salary pressure and do not have the necessary motivation to give up Fultz. If you have the same salary pressure, you can also consider Fournier in New York. Trying Pritchard and DiVincenzo on high-paying short-term contracts is also a direction that can be considered. To sum up, theoretically, the Rockets can free up three positions to make up for people in the summer. Paying attention to shooting skills, especially off-ball shooting ability, should be a focus of summer selection. It is not impossible to get garbage contracts, but only teams that pay taxes can have this motivation, especially those who pay taxes and win the championship may not be able to win. The team is a key poaching target. The theoretical space of the rocket is 60 million, but what really needs to be filled is the poverty line. Excluding the salary of high-ranking rookies and the tens of millions in salary that Martin may renew his contract, he only needs to sign for about 30 million to meet the basic conditions... In addition, apart from space, the Rockets actually do not have many truly valuable chips. ...So even if you want to trade, the target will probably be a player that the opponent ""has to"" deal with, or doesn't want to use at all. In addition to these factors, the player's personal wishes are also an important factor that must be considered. This year, you can be a good person in exchange for being laid off. Next year, no matter who you replace, you must keep the ones who play hard and work hard, whether they use the remaining heat or fight for future contracts. In short, you have to stay solidly in the team, rather than being in a state of Cao Ying and Han Han. Whenever there is a disturbance or there are constant rumors around the trade deadline, it is better to stay away from players... In short, after all, Summer is the big test, it is the key, and filling the poverty line is also a technical job. If you have money but no strength, you will have no use for it, but if you spend the money without making any noise, then that is absolutely unacceptable. Let's wait and see in the summer. The players mentioned above are just examples to demonstrate the factors that should be considered when selecting players. It does not mean that these people must be selected. Everyone can use their imagination and freely discuss suitable reinforcement targets. I'm just reminding you to consider the many factors that go into this decision. #HoustonRockets##nbaoffseason signing and trading#",,,,"Houston Rockets, NBA offseason signings and transactions",1,72,43,2/25/23 23:39,,,,

If a bunch of short guys fall down and fight in a positional battle with tall guys, it will be a dead end. It was essentially inevitable that the Clippers were reversed by 19 points in the park, because the Nuggets had Jokic who could absorb a lot of confrontations, and at that time the Clippers were known to have a top-notch five-shooter lineup (Reggie, Leonard, George, Morris, JaMychal). Green), but there was no way to use speed to consume Jokic, so the small lineup was exhausted in the second half, and finally exhausted himself. Both sides are engaged in positional warfare. People are taller and stronger than you. After the confrontation is exhausted, it is very, very normal for the dwarfs to miss rebounds and hit open shots. If you want to play a small lineup, the most important thing is to have players who can push back. Nash and Kidd are the ones who can pass the ball throughout the court. Dream Green and Antetokounmpo can grab backcourt rebounds. There is also a kind of person who immediately advances by himself. Anyway, you must have this kind of person when you play five minors. It only makes sense if you have many shooters who can catch up. Westbrook is essentially a very necessary supplement to the Clippers' five-small lineup.

4.87E+15,MuoX5FjsF,7479120761,Just love little heat,"Kevin Love details his 'easy decision' to join Heat and how he hopes to help By Anthony Chiang In Kevin Love's 15th NBA season, he's been in just about every basketball situation. But until now, he had never joined a new team mid-season. The 34-year-old Love committed to the Miami Heat during the All-Star weekend after agreeing to a contract buyout with the Cleveland Cavaliers. This was the first time in his NBA career that he changed teams in a season. He signed a new contract with the Heat on Monday worth $3.1 million for the remainder of the season before entering unrestricted free agency this coming summer. To begin the acclimation process, Love headed to the Heat's practice facility at Miami-Dade Arena immediately after signing his contract Monday night. “This is new and new to me,” Love said Wednesday during a Zoom call with a group of South Florida reporters. ""I got traded in the summer of 2014 and I had time to get acclimated to Cleveland, get into their space, their locker room, be with their players, just be in the facility, etc. So for me, as soon as the ink dried, I Just wanting to get in the gym right away and start working with the team. Getting in here and getting used to getting to the arena. ""I've been working out, I've been staying in shape, but there's nothing like five-on-five. So the important thing for me is to come here, show up and start working. Love (6-8, 251 pounds) helps address multiple needs for the Heat as a shooting big man when starting center Bam Adebayo comes off the bench or plays with Adebayo at power forward. He can play center in smaller lineups. If the Heat choose to return Caleb Martin (6-foot-5, 205 pounds) to the bench, Love may also become the team's new starting power forward. Love said: ""I Feel like coming here is a great opportunity for me to further push the strengths that the Heat have had for a long time and help them improve their length, shooting and rebounding and all the strengths in my game. The Heat regrouped in Miami on Thursday for their first practice after the All-Star break before resuming their schedule against the Bucks in Milwaukee on Friday. Love said he also considered joining the Philadelphia 76ers after a buyout . But ultimately he ""always viewed Miami as a place that would be a good landing spot for me,"" even though the Sixers, who are third in the Eastern Conference standings, are ahead of the seventh-place Heat."" It was a very easy decision,"" said Love, one of two players the Heat added during the All-Star break along with veteran center Cody Zeller. ""Obviously, for the people, the money factor and the location, things like that . But for me, it's about the Eastern Conference and what this team needs. ""There's a lot that goes into it. But for me, I think it's that role that allows me to be myself and play to my strengths on a team where I can really make a difference."" When asked about the impact of a starting role on When asked how important he is, Love made it clear that starting ""doesn't matter to me."" Since the start of last season, he has started just seven of 115 games. ""Coach [Erik Spoelstra] is great for a reason, he's a really good communicator,"" Love said. ""He gets the best out of his players and he's been doing that since he took over as head coach. So for me, I'm not going to get excited about it. I really feel like I just want to step in here and Go into the game and learn more about what they've implemented and, yes, definitely see playing time."" Whether he starts or not, there are three areas of Love's skill set that should help the Heat's struggling offense: ▪ Love is An above-average corner three-point shooter. That's especially helpful for the Heat, who are third in the league in corner three-point shooting this season but only shoot a league-worst 34.8 percent from the field. The Heat's overall three-point shooting percentage has been poor. Miami's three-point shooting percentage this season is 33.4%, ranking third from the bottom in the NBA. Love is expected to help boost those numbers as he is an efficient, high-volume 3-point shooter from all over the court, especially from the corner. According to CleaningTheGlass, he has shot 40 percent or better from the corner three-point range in six of the past eight seasons. ▪Love remains an excellent defensive rebounder. Love's defensive rebound rate (the percentage of defensive rebounds a player can grab on the court) was 25.8% last season and is at 29.8% so far this season. To put it in perspective, that's better than Adebayo's team-best defensive rebounding rate of 21.8% this season. Rebounding is not the Heat's weakness. Since the beginning of December, the Heat have ranked fourth in the league in defensive rebounding rate and 11th in offensive rebounding rate. Love should only help in this area, especially on the defensive glass. ▪ Love is known for his impressive outbound passes after grabbing defensive rebounds, which will help the Heat's offense take a more opportunistic approach in transition. That's important for the Heat's offense, which struggles in the half-court. Miami has the NBA's 23rd-ranked half-court offense this season. According to CleaningtheGlass, the Heat are adding just 0.9 points per 100 possessions, which is 10th worst in the league. ""Yeah, I think Bam, definitely Jimmy [Butler], Tyler [Herro], some of the guys on this team, but mostly Bam,"" when asked how he envisioned helping the Heat. Love said. ""I think just spreading the floor for him so he can go downhill and get in position and I can play the five and spread the floor and I can help him rebound on the defensive end. I want to make their lives easier. For the other two that I mentioned among the rest of the team, I feel like I can set screens and help those guys go downhill on a four-and-one. The way you play here, those guys are able to go downhill and toward the basket. The pressure guy will be huge for us. “I think I can definitely complement the skill set of the guys on this team. ""For everything Love offers on the offensive end, there will be a trade-off on the other end as part of the Heat's top-five defense that has become a hallmark of the franchise. While Love can't be expected to switch at this point in his career perimeter player, but the Heat can make up for some of his defensive weaknesses by using zone defenses and other coverages that limit the ball he can defend in isolation situations. Love has appeared in 41 games (three starts) for the Cavaliers this season, averaging He took 4.8 three-point attempts, shot 35.4% from the field, contributed 6.8 rebounds and 1.9 assists, and averaged 8.5 points per game. He returned $1.5 million in the buyout agreement with Cleveland. He suffered a fractured right thumb in November. Played down the field, but was recently out of the rotation, last appearing against the Cavaliers on January 24. Love admitted that the thumb injury affected his outside shooting over the past few months, but he now feels ""fully recovered."" .Will the Heat make Love a starter or a backup? Is this a short-term partnership and don't the Heat hold Love's Bird Rights when he becomes a free agent this offseason? These questions will be discussed in the coming years. Answers will come in days, weeks and months. But for now, with 23 games left in this regular season and a possible early playoff berth, Love fills multiple needs for the Heat and is expected to be available immediately Help. ""This is chapter three with the Miami Heat, which I'm really excited about,"" said Love, who spent his first six NBA seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves before spending the last eight with the Cavaliers.

This team, which has missed the playoffs for 16 consecutive seasons, has undergone radical changes this season after Mike Brown took over. The Kings currently have a record of 32 wins and 25 losses, ranking third in the Western Conference and first in the Pacific Division. ! The higher health of the Kings' players is one of the reasons for the team's improved record, but the substantial improvement in offensive efficiency is even more surprising. Last season they only ranked 25th in the league, but this season they soared to second; defensive efficiency Although it is still ranked in the middle and lower reaches of the league, it has improved by 4 places compared with last season. The team's accelerated progress cannot be separated from the leadership of Sabonis & Fox. Sabonis further amplified his role as the inside axis, and Fox's performance in key goals was eye-catching. They all played the best performance of their careers. And join hands to be selected as All-Stars! The addition of high-quality shooters such as Huerter and Monk as well as rookie Keegan Murray is a wonderful move. It not only brings stable outside shooting to the team, but also enriches the tactical system. Hand-to-hand cooperation and running without the ball have become Routine team operations. Two-thirds of the regular season has passed, but the Kings' position is not stable. The difference between third and 13th place in the Western Conference is only 6 games.

4.87E+15,MumdZja9C,6088370582,Newly used products,"#NBA#Manchester United wants to pack Leicester City's two midfield stars, but the German man skillfully raises the price for Osimhen! On February 23, according to the ""Manchester Evening News"", Manchester United intends to package Leicester City's twin stars, Madison and Tielemans, this summer. With Manchester United now in the takeover process and having received at least two offers, Old Trafford may look completely different this summer. But this will not prevent them from making reasonable plans for the summer window. The team is rapidly recovering under coach Ten Hag and becoming more and more like the giants of the past. According to British media reports, the Fox City duo are considered potential signings for Manchester United. Maddison has been one of Leicester City's star players this season, having contributed nine goals and five assists in 19 appearances. He was also called up by England coach Southgate at the last minute before the World Cup, but ultimately failed to play in Qatar. As for Tielemans, the Belgian has been a key figure in Leicester City's midfield since arriving in the Premier League. The 25-year-old Tielemans' contract with Fox City will expire at the end of this season, and he is likely to become a free agent this summer, which will bring great convenience to him to switch to other teams. It had been widely rumored that he would join Arsenal, but the Gunners seem to be taking the lead in the battle for Rice, and not many people seem to have mentioned the connection between the two. Elsewhere on the court, mainly referring to their preferred signing position of center, there are certain variables in the rumored target Osimhen. The Nigerian striker is considered to be one of Manchester United's favorite targets, and the other one is Kane, who is quite difficult. The 24-year-old Naples striker played 24 times this season, contributed 20 goals + 4 assists, and was directly involved in 24 goals. However, De Laurentiis now stated that the team will try to keep him as long as possible, which you can also understand as a price increase. De Laurentiis said: ""I'm very good at signing contracts. So when Osimhen's suitors came to me, they were blocked. Keeping Osimhen here will not be It's a hard thing to do. But never say never."" ""Sometimes there are offers you just can't refuse, so you never know what's going to happen next. For me, what I can see right now is He will continue to shine here for a long time."" Osimhen's own attitude is very well-behaved: ""Now I focus on Naples, they have the final say. I just want to help my team win games and win trophies.

4.87E+15,Muf7wcdtp,7474258566,MagicRubikYang,"""What is a real ""big-hearted three-point shooter"""" The historical three-point shooters we are familiar with include Curry, Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, etc. But when it comes to being able to shoot three-pointers that determine the outcome of the game in the life and death moments of the playoffs or even the finals, I think it can be Ray Allen, Klay Thompson, Reggie Miller, Steve Kerr, Kyrie Irving. , Lillard and others. Speaking of ""big-hearted three-point shooters"" who are good at shooting key shots, my favorite and most admired one is undoubtedly Ray Allen, of course, not just because of that ""three-pointer of the century."" But speaking of ""three-pointers of the century"", I recently learned about a classic game from the senior blogger ""Play Mamba"" - the 2013 Finals G6. This game is of great significance to me. It is my life. It was the first time I watched an NBA game live. It was also from that time that I fell in love with LeBron James and gradually regarded him as my idol. I was 14 years old that year, and it has been almost 10 years in the blink of an eye. I didn't understand anything at first, and my only impression of this three-pointer was that it was calm, deadly, and resurrected. But now with an in-depth understanding of NBA games, I know that Ray Allen’s three-pointer embodies all the advantages of his entire career in reaching the pinnacle of three-pointers: First of all, this is a shot with only 5.2 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Three-pointer, if this goal is not scored, then the Spurs are very likely to directly win the championship with a 95-92 three-point advantage🏆. The situation at that time was a matter of life and death for the Heat. But Ray Allen made this three-pointer, and it was still hollow. This ""big heart"" attribute may be difficult for many advanced shooters to possess. Secondly, Ray Allen had missed six or seven consecutive three-pointers before he made this three-pointer. For a shooter, if he misses many consecutive shots, it will seriously affect the game state and shooting stability, but Ray Allen's shot His movements and expressions when he hit the three-pointer didn't seem to be affected at all, but the roar after the hit was a rare inner vent for a taciturn, cold-blooded marksman. Furthermore, from Figures 2 to 6, whether from the side, top view, or from the back, you can see that the moment before Ray Allen shot, several thick, silver-black men were desperately trying to attack him. Pounce - ""French sports car"" Parker sprinted the fastest. When Ray Allen shot a three-pointer, he rushed in front of him and opened his arms in an attempt to interfere, causing Ray Allen to almost fall when he landed. Followed closely by Leonard, the Spurs' top defensive leader (although the Spurs' defensive core at that time was still Duncan, the person with the strongest defensive ability has slowly transitioned to Leonard), he had already rushed to the left. Ray Allen was only about one meter away, but unfortunately he was still half a step too slow. Behind Kawhi is Danny Green, the Spurs' strongest ""3D"" player, but unfortunately he is not as fast as Leonard. Behind Green is the ""French Magician"" Diaw. His speed is obviously slower, and he is the farthest away from Ray Allen (because the Spurs are playing a small lineup to prevent the Heat from three-pointers at this time, Diaw replaces Duncan at the 5th position). Wait until When Ray Allen released the ball, he had just started to accelerate and it was already too late. The only person who didn't have time to run was Ginobili. It wasn't that he didn't want to defend, but because he fell down while fighting Bosh for that important rebound. By the time he stood up, Ray Allen had already taken action. . Facing the opponent's defense by almost the entire team, he can still calmly hit a three-pointer in the last few seconds of life and death. This kind of mentality is simply impossible for ordinary people. Finally, there is the feel of the ball when shooting, which is something that many fans tend to overlook. Looking carefully at the details of the shot, the reason why Ray Allen was able to take the three-pointer before Parker, who is known as the ""little sports car"", and Kawhi, who has excellent physical fitness, is because of his extremely familiar perception and understanding of the three-point line. Extremely fast release speed. Bosh grabbed the rebound and quickly passed it to Ray Allen, who was quickly retreating to the right corner. At this time, the Spurs had already begun to accelerate towards Ray Allen. The situation at that time was - Ray Allen retreated completely based on his feeling. Shooting three-pointers very quickly in the small space between the corner three-point line and the sideline. If you don't know the distance of the three-point line very well, who can 100% retreat to neither the three-point line nor the sideline without looking at it at all? What about the location? The funniest thing is that the referees at the time did not see clearly whether it was a three-pointer or a two-pointer because the two sides were fighting too fiercely during the entire shooting process (Heat teammates also asked Ray Allen about it at the time, and Ray Allen himself Did not give a particularly accurate answer), because the referee temporarily decided to suspend the game to watch the video to confirm the shooting score, this incident also made Popovich angry. A calm heart, an excellent three-point shooting sense, and a stable game mentality. How many three-point shooters can do these at the same time?

4.87E+15,Mue7zmH50,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Missing Beverley and Love, why didn’t the Warriors make any moves? 】Beverley chose the latter between the Warriors and Bulls on the grounds that the Eastern Conference is weaker. If you only look at the playoff spot competition area where the Warriors and Bulls are located, this is true. The difference is that compared to the Bulls, who are currently outside the play-offs, the Warriors' ranking is still slightly better. Of course, no one can guarantee what will happen in another half month, and the reasons given by Beverly may not be all. He is originally from Chicago, and returning to his hometown to play is also an attraction. The Warriors have an obvious motive for ""short selection"" for his needs. After Payton returns, in Golden State, which is already overcrowded in the backcourt, it is a question mark how many opportunities Beverley will have. If Beverley is looking for more playing time, the Warriors are definitely not a safe place. Then again, the Bulls are not absolutely lacking in the backcourt, or even defensive players. Although Lonzo Ball is out for the season, the Bulls still have many defenders such as LaVine, Caruso, DeRozan, Dosunmu, White, Dragic, and first-round pick Darren Terry. Some of the Bulls' so-called ""guards"" may be tall or strong, but their real position in the Bulls may be in the frontcourt. For example, DeRozan has basically been swinging at the 3-4 position in the past few years. Caruso's matchup menu is extremely rich, starting from Curry. He defended Kuzma all the way. The position where the Bulls are really short of manpower is the forward line. Javonte Green has been injured for a while and has not yet returned. Jones Jr.'s time has always been limited, so the Bulls will also use backcourt players to swing up to support the frontcourt. It's a bit similar to the Warriors. However, the Bulls' No. 5 position has stable hands and a larger overall body shape, so there is no intuitive feeling of ""small"". In this case, adding a defender with strong defensive ability will not cause much problem with the compatibility on this end. The Bulls' problems lie more on the offensive end. With the fifth position able to stand at a certain point, the Bulls shot the lowest three-point ratio in the league. They are almost the worst team in the league in terms of space. With Beverley's shooting this season, it seems that he has no ability to reverse this situation. . I'm also curious about where Donovan will find time for Beverley: Positionally speaking, the Bulls player closest to Beverley is Caruso, who has a higher overall level and only has only one playing time. 24.3 minutes is not saturated, and there is no room or reason to allocate it to Beverley; then there is Dosunmu, who takes 28.4 minutes per game and is highly used by Donovan. He can do something in all aspects. This functionality Beverley is more or less qualified, and some time may be allocated from him; White is one of the few Bulls players whose three-point output is above the league average, but his absolute level is not as good as Beverley. It depends on how to choose. What does Novan want? Dragic, who can play some ball-handling, and rookie Terry, their positions in the rotation are more marginal. In fact, Dragic is one of the players the Bulls are considering cutting to make room for them. There is a high possibility that they will give time to Beverley. After Green returns, and the team is basically healthy, the Bulls' full-strength rotation is roughly like this - DeRozan, LaVine, Caruso, Pavey, Javonte Green, Vucevi Qi, Zhuang Shen, Beverley, Jones Jr., Dosunmu, White, Dragic. There are many people available, and the defensive intensity can be expected, but there are also many points that can be missed by the three-point line. Donovan relies entirely on the higher-level cards in his hand to play, and most of his offense will not work. DeRozan and LaVine will be suffocated by the double attack. The problem is that Dragic, who is a bit developed, Dosunmu, who can handle the ball, and White, who is a bit shooting, are not very strong offensively. If they are used interspersed, they cannot completely solve the offensive constipation. The inevitable way out for the Bulls is to use defense + star players to solve the problem. Beverley helped them stretch the long board a little bit longer, and nothing has changed where the team's real neck is stuck. Love chose the Heat. The first question about this matter is why the Cavaliers chose to let him go. Love did lose his rotation position in the Cavaliers, but he did not completely lose his immediate combat effectiveness. As an inside shooter, his positioning still has certain strategic value. The Cavaliers seem to be extremely confident about Love's decline. The actual situation is that Love played well at the beginning of the season. In the first three months, his true shooting percentages were 66.6%, 58%, and 58% respectively. The last highlight was at the end of December. The Bulls scored 20 points on 5 of 11 three-pointers. After that, Love's shooting took a big dive. In January, his three-point shooting percentage was only 22.9% and his true shooting percentage was 43%. Considering the huge limitations on the defensive end, it is understandable that the Cavaliers do not use him. Have the Cavaliers considered the possibility of Love returning to form? 66% of Love's shots are from the three-point line. His game contribution is highly tied to the ups and downs of his hand. For a veteran of Love's age, it is not too strange to have a temporary downturn. His shooting skills are as good as Library's. , there was also a long slump last season. The Cavaliers did not choose to wait for Love, but finally let him go despite knowing that he would most likely join their opponents in the same district. This operation was a bit unexpected. One possibility is that the Cavaliers judged from training that Love's physical condition will be difficult to completely correct this season. Another possibility is that Love wants to play, but the Cavaliers are unable to give him time to adjust due to ranking competition. Out of respect for the meritorious veteran, the Cavaliers accepted the result of letting Love go and letting him join a potential opponent. The Heat are indeed one of Love's best next destinations. The Heat's offensive performance this season is extremely poor. It currently ranks 25th in the league in offensive efficiency and 28th in the league in three-point shooting percentage. The outside shooting is generally stretched, there is a lack of space threats at the 4th and 5th positions, and they are hungry for big shooters. If Love's condition improves, it goes without saying that he will provide support in shooting. Love has a good sense of teamwork. Whether as an end point or a support point, it is not difficult to integrate into the Heat's system. The Heat's bet on Love's recovery is a promising investment, which has the opportunity to give them huge support for their sluggish firepower this season. The Heat may also be one of the few teams that can hope to absorb Love's defensive deficiencies. With Love's current physical ability, whether he is used as the fifth position to defend the pick-and-roll and protect the basket, or he is arranged to match up with a striker with a smaller role, he may become a huge loophole, especially in the more targeted playoffs. It is foreseeable that the opponent will seize this point and tear open the defense line indefinitely. The ability at this end determines that Love can only play a low-playing transitional role that takes a small amount of time in the playoffs, and is even unable to appear when encountering specific opponents. But compared to other teams, the Heat still hope to minimize Love's defensive damage. They are the most popular team in the league and the best at zone defense, and may also be the team with the strongest multi-point defense capabilities. Although they don't have many jumping men who can fly out of the diagonal, almost every position player can support the defense by anticipating steals, drawing offensive fouls, breaking up passes, etc. Over the years, the Heat have accumulated a lot of experience in protecting individual defensive weaknesses, which should alleviate the embarrassment of Love being targeted. As the team most promising to activate Love's value, the Heat have an X factor for the rest of the season. However, the Heat did not put all their hopes on Love. They still took another substitute center Zeller. For a team that cannot guarantee that Haslem will only stay on the bench and in the locker room, more backup is necessary. Even for them, putting Love in the fifth position is extremely risky. Some readers will definitely ask these two questions: Is it a pity that the Warriors did not get Love? In other words, have the Warriors ever seriously fought for Love? No pity. The Heat offered Love a 3.1 million contract, not the minimum salary for the remaining season. This is a price that the Warriors simply cannot afford. If you have no chance at all, unfortunately there is no chance. Even if the Heat only offer a minimum salary, I doubt the Warriors' interest in Love. It is true that the Warriors are short of frontcourt players, but unlike the Heat, the Warriors' main problem is defense rather than offense, and Love is a side effect on the defensive end. Rather than spending more money to test a shooting veteran who is partial and declining, the Warriors might as well give Baldwin a chance. Even the Warriors may not be trying very hard to pursue Beverley. Beverley himself said that he chose the former between the Bulls and the Warriors because of the low pressure in the Eastern Conference. He certainly would not say that the sincerity I felt from the Warriors was slightly lacking. The obvious situation is that the Warriors have many important players in the backcourt rotation whose time cannot be reduced, and they can only play in the backcourt. This is because DeRozan and Caruso can appropriately swing up, and White, Dosunmu, and De The time that Radic and others can reduce is different. Not to mention, after Payton returns, Beverley will have to make room. These decisions mean that the Warriors cannot make any sincere commitments at all. For the Warriors, whose luxury tax is too tight and the cost of system integration is extremely high, they do not make ""unsure choices with marginal returns"" in the middle of the season, which has been proven on multiple deadlines. For fans, the lack of real ""reinforcements"" does undermine confidence. But for the boss and the coach, the former has not increased expenses, and the latter has not added new variables that need to be debugged. It is understandable that there is no definite benefit from the introduction of buyout veterans, so it is understandable that they do not take action. A late-dynasty team with fully inflated wages and a deeply specialized system is like a starship accelerating to 1/10 the speed of light. It is extremely difficult to load even one more gram of cargo or make a slight turn of one centimeter. things. This is not a strange thing, this is the rule.

The Clippers' three-point shooting percentage this season is 37.8%, ranking sixth in the league. Among them, catching the ball and shooting three-pointers is more accurate, reaching 39.1%. Westbrook has caught the ball and shot 31.3% of his three-pointers this season. Being around the Clippers' high-quality shooters can cover up his shooting deficiencies. 2. Due to age issues, the Clippers are a slow-playing team in the league. So far this season, the Clippers rank 24th in the league in the number of possessions. The Clippers rank 18th in the league in transition points per game and 19th in transition possessions per game. Mann is basically the only one in the team who can promote fast breaks. This is why the Clippers sought to join Wall in the offseason, but Wall obviously did not achieve the expected results. As an enhanced version of Wall, Westbrook will bring more vitality and offensive and defensive transitions to the Clippers. 3.

4.87E+15,Mu4xwCgjZ,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Westbrook and the Clippers, this may be the ultimate test] Since the break, many things have happened this season that have affected the league structure. Compared with Irving and Durant's journey to the West, Westbrook's signing with the Clippers is really a small operation. With a contract of US$785,000, if this person was not Westbrook, no one would pay so much attention to reinforcements at this level. Five teams in five years, Westbrook, in the later stages of his career, is changing every club he joins with his personal influence. Looking forward, even a better version of him will never be calm. , efficient, and well-known for strategizing. He has never learned how to act as a plug-in that matches the functions of a large system. Wherever he goes, he must require the system to make specific optimizations to adapt to him. In other words, Westbrook is not a plug-and-play puzzle. If you want to use him, you must be prepared to develop a targeted version of Westbrook. If you don't think clearly about this matter, it's better not to sign. The two parties had many discussions before this signing, and the Clippers' requirements were also clear-they only wanted the part of Westbrook they needed, which is the so-called ""specific role."" And please keep the other parts in your memories. How specific the Clippers' requirements for Westbrook are will only be seen in the games after the holidays. According to current reports, the Clippers have not clearly committed to the starting position, but this is actually not enough. In my previous article about the buyout market, my expectations for the Clippers' introduction of Westbrook will be even stricter: Not only can the starting and final lineup positions not be guaranteed, Westbrook must also be prepared to be DNP at any time. If Lu can't do this, or if Westbrook complains about it, causing a negative impact on the locker room, then the Clippers' introduction of Westbrook will be tantamount to digging a hole. For the Clippers, whose situation has improved quite a bit, introducing an unstable X factor is a risky decision. George may have been the driving force behind the signing. In the 18-19 season, his cooperation with Westbrook brought him to the peak of his career. Compared with the embarrassing position of guest point guard now, it is difficult to refute the subjective feelings of the person involved in how to play more comfortably. Westbrook does have a magical passive attribute. Another main attacker who partners with him will almost certainly become a strong contender for the scoring title. Needless to say, Durant and Harden were both ranked second in scoring in Bill's 21st year and James' 22nd year. Of course, without Westbrook, Durant is still Durant. Harden averaged more points per game the year before, Bill was second in the scoring list the year before, and James is still as brave as the year after. Whether Westbrook has BUFF skills or is a lead-filled vest for weight-bearing training, two factions with different positions hold different opinions. But that's not important. Of course, the Clippers did not sign Westbrook just to please and activate George. What is important is that if we count the NBA championships in the past few years, everyone has a serious point guard, or at least an organizer who can play a similar role. The Clippers completely giving up on similar functional team building is too special. They may carve a path out of a patch of untraveled grass, but the unprecedented success method always makes people feel unsure. With a point guard, at least theoretically, the Clippers have no real blind spot. In articles written about the Clippers in the past, there are three key issues that have been emphasized: First, the state of the top attacker, Brother Kaz, determines whether the Clippers' entire offensive sequence can be in place. If he can't stand still, the remaining pieces of the puzzle will have to play roles beyond their capabilities, and the Clippers' offense will naturally be unable to advance. Now, Brother Kaz is getting closer to the distance he had before his serious injury; secondly, with Zubac/without Zubac, both forms are not ideal. The Clippers' large lineup and small lineup each have their weak points. You will encounter opponents who take both of their forms. This problem was mostly solved by Plumlee's deal. Between the big and the small, the Clippers have a big enough and maneuverable form. Moreover, Plumlee's ability to support and handle 4-on-3 also provides the Clippers with better options for off-ball and breaking teams; third, the Clippers do not have a real point guard, which makes them activate the pick-and-roll. Threats in the middle, finding mismatches on fast breaks, hitting the ball in the low post, and even breaking the full-court press at certain times can lead to minor troubles. These small troubles are not easy to notice in a single round or two, but when encountering certain opponents, small troubles can accumulate and become big troubles. After the trade deadline, only the last of the three key issues is left. Of course, Westbrook can complete these tasks that need to be completed by the point guard, and he can do it far better than Hyland. Westbrook can even bring some extra content. He steps on the Hot Wheels, with Powell and Mann flying on both wings, followed by Kajiao who follows up, which can create a beautiful three-dimensional blitz. With the cooperation of the Clippers' all-shooting lineup, he can contribute lethal sudden points and improve the Clippers' impact shortcomings. Westbrook holds the last vacant screw that the Clippers want, and can even provide this giant ship with a strong wind to propel it forward. These are all reasons why the Clippers need him. Then, the Clippers will find that Westbrook has erected a sail on the giant ship, and the angle of this sail cannot be adjusted. This is a modern ship propelled by propellers. It can move forward with or without sails. If there is a headwind, the sail will actually get in the way. This is a problem that all teams that get Westbrook must face - while enjoying Westbrook's contribution, they must bear the by-products he will inevitably bring. The way most teams try to solve the side effects is to increase Westbrook's leading role. , the Thunder, Rockets, and Wizards have all followed this routine. For the Lakers who cannot do this, the solution is to substitute Westbrook to treat the symptoms rather than the root cause. The Clippers can only give Westbrook less authority than the Lakers. Although the Clippers have a better environment for Westbrook - more shooters, the main player can switch off the ball, and can transfer the organizational role - we also have higher offensive expectations for the Clippers, which are in line with the 20-21 season. The firepower level of the version, and Westbrook obviously has some characteristics that will destroy the Clippers' offense in that version: almost everyone on the Clippers is a high-quality shooter, with full space, but Westbrook will become a space flaw in the five-out lineup, and the opponent may He will use a center to guard him; when the Clippers fill up the space, they can use simple one-on-one, short-distance bursts, and outside plays to seek simple and efficient shooting opportunities, thereby reducing unnecessary mistakes and inefficient non-elite players. CIC, Westbrook's style of play will naturally bring these unnecessary contents. In many situations, the Clippers can rely on space + strikers and wing attacks to solve problems. While Westbrook provides the icing on the cake, it destroys the simplicity, efficiency and beauty of the five-out play, and may even be a ""do more, make more mistakes"" exist. Only when the Clippers' overly simple style of play fails, do they really need to seek changes. The Clippers cannot guarantee that they are a team that can score full points against different opponents. In some situations, they will worry that they are still 5 to 10 points away from passing the test. Maybe Westbrook will be a life-saving card at this time. You can think of Westbrook as an ""Ogre Infantry"". The effect is that there is a 50% chance of attacking the wrong enemy, and your advantage is that you have the initiative to use him. Can the Clippers only play this card at the right opportunity? For Lue, this could be the ultimate test. For Westbrook, this is also the ultimate test - this may very well be Westbrook's last chance to prove his worth to a championship-level team. He cannot develop an elite jump shot overnight, but he must try his best to suppress the desire to play a superhero, put his ""service"" consciousness first, and use an image closer to Jarvis to appear next to another pair of superstars in Los Angeles. . For the star with the greatest game energy in NBA history, asking him to reduce the power of his engine is probably more difficult than asking him to fight for his life. There are two sets of data: 25.9% round share, 49.7% true shooting rate, 11 assists per 100 rounds, 2.23 assist-to-loss ratio, 27.6% round share, 49.6% true shooting rate, 11.9 assists per 100 rounds, 2.13 assist-to-loss ratio One is Wall and the other is Westbrook. If Westbrook doesn't make any changes for the Clippers, you can roughly guess the result. What we want to see is either a different Westbrook. Or, just one who doesn't play. Unless, he and Hyland have to choose one.

4.87E+15,Mu2p4B6g4,6087450499,Encore’s five-dimensional pocket,"How should we evaluate LeBron's Lakers career? I have to admit that, except for the 2020 championship, the Lakers under LeBron have turned into a farce under the magnifying glass of the social media era, total score record narrative and frequent transactions. The Lakers game was ugly. LeBron was found guilty of countless possessions that were suspected of being a score-saver. Twitter is often dominated by LeBron's greasy bragging about being ""middle-aged"" after a loss. Some of LeBron's qualities were magnified and twisted, turning them into flaws. For example, he doesn't like to jump when defending. He is smart and guiding. He will clearly judge that the rotation of the ball/passing over to interfere may be useless, and it is better to directly play quickly, which will be more helpful in winning the game in terms of ""mathematical expectation"" - So he's good at guarding Pierce, not Durant - but when the team's record is not good, these missed possessions will become the only reason for losing. Some even believe that LeBron's analytical choices are also reflected in setting the tone for the entire season. He will cherish the remaining energy in his later years, judge whether the team has the qualifications to ""compete for the championship"" this season, and then decide whether he should devote more to ""victory"" or ""personal records."" Some of these accusations are true, and some are heart-wrenching remarks, but many of them violate the political correctness of competitive sports and NBA legends. And we cannot deny that, at least on the Chinese forums: a player of the Presidential level in basketball history fell into the lowest point of publicity at the end of his career, so that his entire career achievements were counterattacked. But I think LeBron’s Lakers career — even the last three years of his career — is still underrated. No one retains as much hatred as he does. ——Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Duncan have already become engineers at their age and do not have to bear the expectations of the boss. ——Kobe and Jordan’s 38-year-old seasons, when we look back afterwards, we default to them as non-competitive tours that give back to fans, so we selectively ignore Russell. Zeng Yinyang said: “I didn’t understand until I came to the Nets. What is the correct system?"" - Ignores Lou Williams' recall of Kobe Bryant saying: ""From now on, I have to get the ball every time I advance, and you all have to fucking learn how to play with Kobe."" - Ignores Jordan's career with the Wizards He was also viciously attacked by the media. No one is under the magnifying glass like him. The days when a good relationship with one or two senior media figures can control the story are long gone. Only in the past five years has the right to comment been truly delegated to everyone. ——Will anyone accuse Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of being completely unable to guard Olajuwon and Sampson in the 1986 Western Conference Finals? No, we are obviously lamenting how miraculous it is that he can maintain 26+10 against the Rockets Twin Towers at his advanced age. ——We accuse LeBron of relying on the dividends of the times to maintain his offensive data, but why do we ignore when criticizing his defense that this is the most difficult defense and requires a lot of rotations. You cannot focus on a player who only rushes rebounds and makes brainless cuts. What about the era of role players lying in the paint? ——Isn’t it common for superstars at the end of their careers to only bet on offense and defense? Then, in a 67-win team like the 16-year-old Spurs, which has no shortage of offense, becoming a great defender who averages 9 points per game in 25 minutes is really better than playing 37 minutes and averaging 30 points per game in the Lakers, who are obviously poor in offense and incompatible. Noble and conducive to victory? No, I'm not sure. It's just that we prefer the former image of the sweeping monk. It's just that everyone prefers the feeling of ""you can't tell that he's awesome at first glance, but I can analyze it."" (Including myself) LeBron's basic data in 2022 is about the same as in 2012. It can be seen that the times are regressing, so all LeBron's adjustments are not worth mentioning. Of course, today's offense is far simpler than it was a decade ago. But do we quantify this addition? Is it possible that after cutting off this increase, this performance is still unique for a veteran? Is it possible that there is also a factor in this that LeBron is good at maintaining and adjusting his playing style? Because there are also many stars who have declined. Is it possible that the Lakers are actually not good at three-pointers, and they cannot be regarded as a team where the ultimate space in modern basketball automatically increases player offense? The Lakers in 2022 and 23 will be plagued by injuries. They have to change their starting lineup almost every twenty games and their finishing lineup every five games. The Lakers in 2022 and 23 have guards that are least compatible with LeBron and poor spacing. LeBron's output is still stable, averaging 30 points per game with a shooting percentage of more than 50%, relying on changes in his offensive form. He went to do handoffs with Beverley; he played screener and cutting forward for Westbrook; he acted as a small-ball center to save the Lakers' offense; he is still the league's top transition master; he played for two years In 101 games, Davis played in 75 games. He needs to shoot a lot of strange half-cut fadeaways, floaters, and one-leg drifting jumpers toward the baseline; he has shot 7 and 8 three-pointers respectively in the two seasons. For the first time in his life, he has to be someone else's shooter, and for the first time in his life, he has to become an all-conference shooter. The team's best space resource, he only took 2.4 and 3.3 shots ten years ago; are these adjustments? Are these adjustments considered “sacrifice”? Or do we view this as a sacrifice only if the inability to adapt to the new role leads to a sharp decline in performance? Is it a matter of course that the adjustment is successful? An all-around star can only show his talent in a distorted environment. LeBron's career with the Lakers actually shattered the rumors that he ""must have space and a shooter to play"", ""cannot play without the ball"", and ""cannot partner with a center"", showing the most fragmented and richest game content . But because of the results, no one cares or takes it seriously. Going back to the beginning of the article, are those heart-wrenching remarks and the insistence on taking technical free throws selfish? I have no idea. But they do exist and can certainly serve as a stain on LeBron. As much as I still hate his public overtures to Irving and Westbrook, this is not what most great leaders are like in history. But at the end of his career, he averaged 30 points per game and supported a Lakers team with a distorted lineup and poor attendance. Is he adapting to the team by changing himself, or is he sucking the blood of the team? I think we should also have a fair evaluation. In the Internet age, no one can get a one-dimensional narrative without impurities. No one’s idol can be the perfect boy next door, and no one hates the fact that success depends entirely on picking up the pieces along the way. To be honest, I expect LeBron to compete for the championship as the second or third leader or even a supporting role. Because never before have we seen a complete change in the form of a great player's game. Jordan, Kobe, and Shaq all had their apocalyptic crowns while their dominance was still there. Their adjustments were a process in which the main attacker used skills to compensate for physical degradation. Therefore, the Wizards Jordan still uses the mid-range to digest the ball. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Duncan have reduced their offensive roles, but you can't think that there is any huge change in their roles and playing styles when they attack Laimbeer and Bosh. Magic and Bird, they were swallowed up by injuries, and I only have pity when I think of them. But LeBron has this opportunity. He is more comprehensive than anyone in history. We have not seen the version of LeBron from Green and Boris Diaw. We have not seen LeBron who can defend when he only averages 14 points per game. What kind of energy breaks out in an end or series. This moment may come true with the Lakers, or it may not. I don't even know if he'll have to be 45 before he drops to 14 points per game. At that time, I may also have a private joking discussion with my friends, ""LeBron, you hugged your thigh again!"" while turning on the TV to study it with relish. ""Good guy, can you still play like this?""",,,,,175,281,1190,2/21/23 14:33,iPhone 12 Pro Max,,,

4.87E+15,MtZk1h9OD,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"Russell Westbrook is signing with the Los Angeles Clippers. Probably, the Clippers are determined to be a spoiler. It was said at this time last year that the Celtics - then fifth in the East - were the most dangerous team in the East. The feeling of a strong team: smooth and unrestrained, flowing smoothly, no one can beat you! Dangerous feeling: scary, unable to hold it down, maybe it will jump up and beat you up? Since 2020, the Clippers and Celtics have some similarities in temperament: ace wings; tough defense; a lot of people have baskets, but lack an organizational soul, so the offense is unstable; positional battles often cannot leave space, and they are aggressive He surrendered, but when he opened the minced meat, he could still be beaten to the point of pain. I always thought the Celtics were the youth version of the Clippers. Unexpectedly, it was the Celtics who advanced to the finals last season. But the Clippers are still very dangerous this season. The Clippers' ball-free and passing performance before this season was, to put it politely, not very good; for two consecutive seasons, George was the team's assist leader. On the offensive end, the pace is not fast, the attack on the basket is not fierce, and it relies on singles, mid-range shots and peripheral luck. But Coach Lu has won the hearts of the people, and the Clippers are tenacious and tough, especially a good defensive player: they played against the Suns a few days ago, and they won the last team without a point guard. Mann + Leonard + Covington / Batum + George can be the most comprehensive closing lineup in the league. It can be paired with Zubac / Plumlee to carry the lineup, or Morris can swing infinitely. There are other excellent closing lineups throughout the league, but few are as suitable for a playoff game as the Clippers. Therefore, although the Clippers currently only have the fourth regular season record in the Western Conference and often bump into each other in the regular season, this lineup is designed to be a spoiler. But the Clippers don't completely need organizers. After all, the game lasts 48 minutes, and it's impossible to switch defenses and fight against others every moment. The Clippers recruited Wall before in an attempt to use him as an instigator, but the effect was not good. Now that they were originally short of point guards, they also sent away Reggie and Wall, and recruited Hyland and Westbrook. The meaning is quite clear: they have unlimited defense changes, take turns in singles, and don't pay much attention to the commander when it comes to life and death. , but usually we really need someone who can push the rhythm and score points: What Wall didn't do, you should try to do it. Westbrook's current situation is well known to everyone: he has no basket, his offensive efficiency with the ball is not good, his control errors are poor, and his single defense is not very good; the threat without the ball is especially bad. After knee surgery in 2019, he has been in this state. However, in the 2020-21 season, he won the assists title with the Wizards and had his last peak season - averaging 22 points, 12 rebounds, 12 assists per game, and 38 triple-doubles. The Wizards also made the playoffs that year. How will the Wizards use Westbrook in the spring of 2021? Use the swing forward line of Ryan + Hachimura + Avdija to switch defense; let Westbrook push the speed to counterattack, and fall into positional battle. Westbrook is responsible for dealing cards to find teammates to cut through, or to ace Bill. If the Clippers also use Westbrook in this way, they can probably switch defenses, which the Clippers are very good at. Westbrook deals cards to find teammates? The Clippers have no shortage of shooters, and: Paul George's best season in his career, that is, the year he finished third in regular season MVP votes in the 2018-19 season, was paired with Westbrook in the Thunder. It's worth noting Westbrook's offensive threat with the ball, but his passing is still reliable. There doesn't seem to be any conflict between him and the Clippers' disruptive temperament. As mentioned above, strong teams are smooth and smooth, while dangerous teams are very unpredictable: most of them are not smooth, but they are good at disrupting the rhythm of the strong ones in the noise and chaos. Westbrook is such a big player. If he is bad, he can take his own rhythm off track. If he is ruthless, he can destroy the opponent's rhythm. Since Durant left the Thunder, Westbrook has only won one playoff series, the Rockets vs. Thunder in 2020: Even in that series, he didn't play well. But the last series he and Durant won together was the 2016 Western Conference semifinals, when the Thunder defeated the Spurs. In that series, Durant averaged 29+7+4 per game and Westbrook averaged 25+7+11 per game. Durant is the Thunder's stable source of scoring, but those who have experienced it will naturally remember: in that series, the Thunder made the Spurs uncomfortable because of Adams' internal fighting and Westbrook's sprint. When the rhythm was on the Spurs' side, Aldridge and Leonard could still beat the Thunder steadily; but when Westbrook got the Thunder up to speed, the Spurs were dizzy. As for the subsequent Western Conference finals, how the Thunder once went through the meat grinder and led the 73-win Warriors 3-1. Everyone remembers-in the three games the Thunder won in that series, Westbrook scored 27 points and 12 assists, 30 points and 12 assists and 36 A triple-double. Russell Westbrook is one of the few diesel chainsaws in NBA history. Smoothness and stability have never been with him, but running wildly, causing chaos and tearing when making noises and mistakes is his specialty. If things go wrong, they will behave in a rude manner and provoke complaints from neighbors. If things go well, it will evolve into making a lot of noises and making everyone get high together. Now he has joined the Clippers, a team that lacks a starting shooting guard and is a meat grinder with unlimited switching. If you are afraid of affecting the chemical reaction of the starting lineup, then let him start with more substitutes and run for fifteen or twenty minutes in each game. Is it possible? (Although whether starting or finishing, it is probably better to play Mann...) Of course, this move is a bit of a gamble after all. After all, in the past three or four years, apart from the Wizards, Westbrook has not been smooth on any team - as mentioned above, his style of play is just a disruptor, and smoothness has nothing to do with him - so it was also reported a few days ago that the Clippers Worrying about whether Westbrook will destroy locker room chemistry. But in the end, the Clippers still have to sign Westbrook. It can be understood like this: On the one hand, Bradley Beal said about Westbrook some time ago: ""He is an excellent teammate. In terms of character, he is not like what many people describe. if you are his teammate, he fights for you, he loves the team; if he makes a mistake, he will be more self-critical before getting angry at you... He knows where I like to receive the ball, and he will let it It's easier for you to play."" In the year when Beal was paired with Westbrook, he averaged second in the league in points per game. In addition to him, Westbrook has also worked with Durant and Harden, the two scoring champions. George averaged a career-high 28 points per game while working with him; Leonard probably won't have any difficulties working with Westbrook. Westbrook himself probably understands that this is his last chance in the NBA. On the other hand, even though they knew that signing Westbrook might be a bit of a gamble, it was almost time for the Clippers to take a gamble: they made a big move this month, sending away Wall, Kennard and Reggie. The wave of people brought in: Westbrook and the new Gordon are both 34 years old, and the new Plumlee is almost 33 years old; think about the original people of the Clippers: Batum is 34 years old, and George is postseason this year. He was 33 years old at the time of the game, Covington was 32 years old, and Leonard was 31 years old. This was his fourth season with the Clippers and he had played 143 regular season games. Their core team is really quite young. The signing of Westbrook, and a series of previous moves, means that for the Clippers and Westbrook, this is the final sprint to disrupt the situation: ""Let's go wild for the last time! - After all, we are all getting old."" #西沙joinfast Boat#",,,,Westbrook joins Clippers,58,123,769,2/21/23 6:43,Weibo web version,['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hbapza7cpkj30n00amwpa.jpg'],,

I really can't be distracted. It can't be said that just for love, I just ignore my daughter's study and life. I took advantage of a few minutes before going to bed to watch this year's three-point and dunk contests. They were more exciting than last year. There was a buzzer beater in the three-point contest. Lillard is my favorite star. Winning the three-point title also fulfilled a wish. Especially at the last point, when he lost a ball and had to score four points in a row, he withstood the pressure and made every shot. He was indeed a big heart. The slam dunk contest is so incredible. Mark McClung, a little man of 1.88 meters, conquered the referees and the audience with three 50-pointers. His amazing jumping, super strong staying in the air, and his unparalleled mid-air turn are the perfect combination of skill and violence. Fusion. After talking about basketball, let’s talk about football. I haven’t paid much attention to the Champions League since the World Cup. I was shocked when I saw the football news today. Paris Saint-Germain lost three games in a row. At the beginning of the season, they were clamoring to win the championship. Fortunately, tonight we defeated Lille 4:3 in a highlight match. All MMN tridents scored, especially Messi scored the winning free kick in stoppage time, proving who is the NO who can turn the tide. .1. My daughter will take the municipal quality inspection exam tomorrow. Without sufficient preparation, I hope her daughter will have an unexpected surprise, such as a three-point shooter suddenly having a hot touch on the basketball court, or a miraculous stroke in a tight football match.

4.87E+15,MtLmzsrrr,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"McClung, the 2023 All-Star Dunk King. ——Saved this year’s slam dunk contest, and maybe not just this year. ——And it may open up a new way for the slam dunk contest and even the All-Star Weekend. When he was invited, he was still in the Development League. At first glance, he was white, with a height of 188 centimeters, a wingspan of 188 centimeters, and a standing reach of 7 feet 10. He was not good in any aspect. But once it flies, it's amazing. The wingspan that limited McClung's basketball career in the past may have become his selling point today. When I watched his last dunk, I thought: If LaVine or Gordon were at their peak, they would probably be able to try this move - but both of them are much taller than McClung. The video of his dunk has already been circulated before. 720-degree spin, reverse dunk without looking at the basket, and so on, but today it was on the big stage: ""The little guy from the Development League surpassed the NBA star."" Good process, good story. And a story like this is interesting enough, isn't it? Isn't the slam dunk contest just for fun? In 1976, the ABA held its first slam dunk contest. Of course, it was not for any serious purpose, but just for fun. At that time, the ABA prided itself on being a flashy, street-style entertainment league. The top player was Dr. J with an afro. It was ""kind of like college basketball, but more vicious"" (Jerry Sloan said) and ""the 1960s."" The era of explosive scoring is over and everyone pays attention to defense"" (Jerry West said) in the NBA. The Iceman attempted a 360-degree dunk and failed. Skywalker played windmill. In the end, Dr. J shocked the whole audience with a dunk from the free throw line. The Iceman later went to the NBA and won four scoring titles. Skywalker competed with him for the 1978 scoring title and scored 73 points in a single game, not to mention Dr. J. Nowadays, the NBA Slam Dunk Contest may not be able to gather such a big-name lineup. Nothing else: At that time, there were few tricks in basketball, and superstars were happy to entertain the public. What's the point of the slam dunk contest? It’s pointless, it just looks good! The NBA held an All-Star Slam Dunk Contest in 1984. Dr. J went to participate at the age of 34 and lost to Larry Nance's windmill. To put it another way: Dr. J, who is the master of dunking, does not say that he will cherish his feathers. It was indeed a time for national entertainment. Digression: It was also 1984, when Stern took office and Jordan entered the industry. As we all know, that was one of the most important years in NBA history. The dunk contest in the 1980s was still star-studded. Jordan, Wilkins, and the gliders went back and forth, and Jordan and Wilkins even had a tense relationship in those years. The 170-centimeter Potato Weber took the little man's dunking to the extreme, using his 360-degree turn dunks and alley catch reverse dunks. In the final shot of Jordan's dunk contest in 1987, his body tilted almost parallel to the floor, flying into a horizontal line, directly cutting to the basket, ""kissing the basket"" dunk; in 1988, after he completed the stretch after collecting the ball in the air 's ""Kiss the Basket,"" and then the famous free throw line dunk. In 1988, Dominic Wilkins completed a toss-up, a jump from the free-throw line, a half-body slam, and then the famous full-moon windmill. Small stature, flying and violent aesthetics are all achieved to the extreme by them. So everyone started using equipment: In 1986, Gerald Wilkins flew out of a chair and dunked from the free throw line. In 1991, Dee Brown won the championship with a blindfolded dunk with his left hand. In 1992, Ceballos blindfolded his eyes with a piece of cloth and performed a blind dunk. In 1996, Brent Barry became the dunk king - after dunking from the free throw line, he opened his jacket and revealed the words: ""White people can fly too."" By the 21st century, it was all familiar to us, a mixture of tributes and tricks: Nate Robinson flying over Webb; Dwight Howard dunking in a Superman cape; Nate Robinson stepping over Dwight for a dunk; Gerald Green blowing Candle dunk and barefoot dunk; Griffin dunk on the fly; Mickey dunks on double baskets. There are more and more tricks, but it’s easy to get over the freshness. Generally speaking, the year of Carter and Francis in 2000 and the years of LaVine vs. Gordon are the glorious years of the 21st Century Slam Dunk Contest: these guys--I personally think that we can also add Richardson to win the championship. In those two years, his dunks were not the most beautiful, but his determination to challenge the difficulty was actually the only one seen at that time - it was just relying on his own talents without resorting to gimmicks, coupled with his different styles, to create exciting scenes. But such a good slam dunk contest also depends on the year: Carter, LaVine and Gordon, who are young, strong and energetic, do not exist every year. Superstars are not as willing to show off as they were in the 1980s. The fancy gimmicks were made aesthetically fatigued by Dwight and Nate. Where to find it? Therefore, McClung's victory this year is a good phenomenon and a good direction: Don't be too rigid in your thinking and don't limit yourself to the 30 NBA teams; if the NBA is no longer fresh, look for the Development League. Maybe even push it a little further? Is it not even limited to the dunk contest? Three-point shooting contest, skill contest, bringing in the G-League or even private marksmen? Invite those who have great skills but cannot play in the NBA due to shortcomings - mostly physical talent - are you invited? To put it bluntly, we have to think clearly: During the All-Star Weekend, should we stick to the rules, or should we be open to all possibilities and try to focus on what everyone likes to watch? Thinking about the fancy performances during the All-Star Weekend, there is nothing to argue about; usually everyone is very careful about load management and data control when playing games. It is rare to have a slightly loose stage where you can live as much as you want. After all, before 1984, there was no slam dunk contest in the NBA. In fact, it all started from scratch until today. When the Slam Dunk Contest was first established, Dr. J did not care about success or failure. They came out to show off their abilities just to entertain the public; scoring superstars like Jordan and Wilkins participated in the Slam Dunk Contest, and substitutes like Webber Just let everyone have fun watching the showdown. According to the original intention of All-Star Weekend, you have to make people enjoy watching it first - everything else will come later. If the All-Star Weekend has no entertainment value, the big names refuse to come, the younger guys can’t have fun, and every year they know it’s not fun, but they still have to pretend to be prosperous and say they’re entertaining the public, but in reality they’re familiar faces and perfunctory, then what’s the point?",,,,,47,59,594,2/19/23 19:10,Weibo web version,['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hb90cwfniyg30eg0857wk.jpg'],,

4.87E+15,MtCHwg4gu,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Let’s talk about the 21st and 22nd rookies] As in previous years, the Rookie Game kicks off the All-Star Weekend. Just like in previous years, there is nothing to watch in the Rookie Game itself. The highlight is who is selected for the Rookie Game. Although being selected for the Rookie Game is not a big honor compared to the All-Star Game, it can be regarded as a mid-term exam and an opportunity to evaluate the development of young people. The picture below shows the basic situation of the 21st and 22nd lottery picks, as well as the non-lottery picks who participated in this year's rookie game. The players selected for the rookie game are named in red. Among the players selected for the rookie game this year, Ethan and Hylander, who played the least minutes, averaged 19.4 minutes per game. It can be seen that about 20 minutes is the lower limit for selection. Moreover, playing time is also the number one criterion for selection in a sense. After all, the prerequisite for a rookie to get everyone's attention is to win the game first. Among first- and second-year rookies who averaged more than 25 minutes per game, only Herb Jones, Reeves and Keith Porter went undrafted. Jones is capable enough and was selected as a freshman. Keith Porter is in a team that lacks a sense of presence, and he also lacks shining points. Reeves is a severely underestimated ""Mr. Correct"". He does not waste the ball, is good at making correct offensive and defensive judgments, and has the underrated toughness to defend against non-talented players. You can look back at how he prevented Tang Shen from catching the ball in the game against the Warriors and how he tried to interfere from behind the screen. Players entering the rookie game can be divided into three types: The first type is the key training target of a bad team (or a team originally expected to be a bad team) and can get stable and sufficient time, including Banqueiro, Mobley, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr., Sohan, Josh Guidy, Ivey, Duren. No matter how well these people perform, in the short term, their lottery status and the fact that the team has no record pressure will ensure that they get enough time to let go. Their living environment is undoubtedly far better than that of other rookies, such as the Spurs' Sohan. Based on his performance in the early season, not to mention the playoff teams, teams in the play-off range, even a slightly impatient coach will consider him Brainless DNP. But because the number of losses is the KPI of the Spurs coaching staff, Sohan's troubles are not a negative factor for the Spurs' overall situation. This allows his shining points to be revealed as the schedule progresses, and some of his ball handling gradually takes shape, showing the outline of an organizational forward. . But unlimited opening is not unlimited. Young people playing in bad teams will have two effects. One is to improve their own skills, and the other is that the team's poor record will lead to more high-ranking draft picks. After a year of playing, another talented young man will join in to share your ball rights. We are all familiar with the ""story of three monks who ran out of water"", so the team cannot always give equal access to talented young people, otherwise everyone may not be able to play. If the previous rookie fails to succeed, the top pick he led the team to win may replace him and become the new key training target until a truly suitable team core emerges. Therefore, high-ranking rookies also have to ""come ashore"". Mobley and Bankero were undoubtedly ashore. There are functional differences between Josh Giddy and SGA. Several other high-ranking Thunder picks are inside or forward. He has a unique position as a high-defender organizer and can be considered basically ashore. The young people of the Rockets and Pistons are more variable, especially the Rockets. The Rockets' problem is that they don't have a team-building core worthy of being entrusted with the future. Compared with the optimism two years ago and one year ago, I will reflect on the fact that I may have been too optimistic before. The biggest question for Jaylen Green may not be when he can become an efficient scorer, but whether his ceiling is worthy of being the big brother of a strong playoff team. The small second position with poor passing and poor defense is a compatibility disaster in the NBA. The four little guys (Pool, Simmons, Herro, and Maxi) who are a little better than Jaylen Green want to be scolded every day. You can probably predict Green's future situation. Mitchell may be the ceiling of this category in the league today, but he has not really entered the league's top 10 topics so far, not to mention that Mitchell's starting point for confrontation and defense is much higher than Jaylen Green. Not only Green, but others can't see the extremely high ceiling. At most, Porter can move up the ladder and touch the floor of a qualified starting point guard, while Shen Jing's realistic goal is to become Sabonis Jr. For Jabari Smith Jr. to succeed, he has to build on the success of others. He is more like a puzzle than the other three. Everyone's upper limit is not enough. If the Rockets team wants to rise, the entire team needs to show a concentrated explosion of talents, rather than relying on individual stars to rise to the top. The team then integrates assets and builds a team around him. This is obviously not easy. What's pressing is that since the draft picks are partially controlled by the Thunder, it will be difficult for the Rockets to mess up next season, which makes their draft lottery this year crucial. If the No. 1 pick is drawn, the Rockets will be saved. If it was the second pick, would the Rockets dare to bet on another guard? The Pistons fare slightly better. Although you can't say that the upper limit of CC+Ivey's backcourt combination must be higher, the first-round protection given by the Pistons to the Knicks is much stricter. They don't have the trouble of the Rockets being controlled by others in consecutive first rounds. For Ivey and Duren, the competition is extremely fierce. If the Pistons get the first two picks, Bunyama and Henderson will need to free up a hole in the inside and backcourt. And even if you don't consider the 2023 draft, the Pistons still have four young insiders in Duren, Wiseman, Stewart, and Bagley. It's a bit of a trick. Duren obviously has a little pressure. The second type, with a very high or higher pick, is regarded as a key training target, but it does not exceed the importance level of the team's overall strategy. Including Barnes, Wagner, Shen Jing, Murphy, Keegan Murray, Marcelin, Jaylen Williams, AJ Griffin, Tali Eason, Kessler. I put Barnes in this category, not in the first group. Although Barnes is the Raptors' absolute focus and not for sale, judging from the direction of the Raptors' operations in recent years, they have never been determined to become a bad team. The ""bad performance"" of the season before selecting Barnes was largely due to excessive injuries. This season, the Raptors chose to bring in Poeltl to win now amid the constant voices of dismantling the team. Barnes has never been given the authority to shoot with him as the absolute core. Objectively speaking, with the abilities he has shown so far, he is indeed more like a multi-functional puzzle than the first main attacker. He will have a much better ball-holding prospect than OG, but no one can guarantee that he will not be able to become the core of the forward ball-handling team. This is probably one of the reasons why the Raptors are unwilling to completely abandon the existing team. Wagner, Shen Jing, and Jaylen Williams, all three of them could see the potential to develop offense before the draft, but when the team acquired them, they did not aim to build the core of the team. Most teams don't think that a white forward of Wagner's type can become a superstar. Being the second or third ball-handling point is a more realistic prospect. But so far, Wagner is the leader of the same class of rookies. His ball-handling talent is very attractive, and his playing style is more core than Mobley and Barnes. In a voice that sounded both joking and serious, Shen Jing truly became the Rockets' most promising young man, and before the draft, everyone seemed to have the same expectations for him. ""He will be good, but he shouldn't be the best one on your team."" Jaylen Williams looks far like the Thunder's favorite rough guy in the past with slender limbs who only knows how to play fast breaks. In fact, he has very good offensive ability with the ball, but he may only become the Thunder's third or even fourth ball-handling point in the future. Murphy, Murray, Griffin, their types perfectly match the needs of the team. Murphy's selling point before joining the industry was shooting, and what the Pelicans need most is resources to open up space for the main generals. After Murphy unexpectedly fulfilled his expectations, people unexpectedly discovered that his tendency to dunk was blocked by his thin arms and legs. Hidden - this person has only one less dunk than James this season. He can fly whenever he can on a fast break. Murray and the Kings have the same goals and needs. The Kings' demand is that they ""must enter the playoffs"", but the shortcoming is that they are short of forwards. Murray is an older and mature forward shooter, and he was also expected to be able to play well before the start of the season. AJ Griffin fills the void of the Hawks' forward shooting and accurately meets the team's needs. He is most famous for his consecutive alley-oop buzzer beaters, which has been a rookie record for many years. Ethan's type is not popular, and the Rockets are not lacking in this kind of energy-based striker who can hold the ball a little and shoot. He can stand his ground and is considered to be highly accomplished in this type. Ethan's front rebound rate is as high as 10.6%, which is comparable to that of a center. He has full steals and blocks. He is the best among unconventional forwards. Kessler is one of the gains of the Jazz's trade from Gobert. He has basically secured the Jazz's future starting position at No. 5. Kessler is a player with a foreseeable lower limit. With excellent defense and finishing play, this type of center can quickly find room for survival in the NBA. But to be as good as this - one of the 10 best defensive centers in the league this season, and at the same time not slowing down the offense - is probably hard to guess. At least, the Timberwolves didn't guess it. Marceline is difficult to tell. On the one hand, he is very good, dares to fight hard, has energy, and is not afraid of taking responsibility. This is a characteristic that makes a rookie easily stand out. On the other hand, he also needs to find his own direction. How will this tall swingman be positioned in the future? If we can’t improve our shooting, defense, and selection, today’s advantages may turn into disadvantages in two years. I don't think he's fully ashore yet. Players in this group have become indispensable members of the home team's rotation without absolute core treatment. In addition to their own abilities, there is still a premise that cannot be ignored - their home team can withstand the loss of training new players, or they have no choice but to use new players. Except for Murray, Murphy, and Griffin, none of the other players are on a playoff team, and none of their home teams have the goal of reaching the playoffs. The purpose of the Kings selecting the older Murray is to enrich the forward line and prepare for the playoffs. The Pelicans are a youth team, and Murphy, as a shooter, is a scarce resource on this team. The Eagles don't have many options for forward shooting. Therefore, in this group, environment is still the prerequisite for success. The third type is to seize the team's vacancies and get opportunities to advance. Including Grimes, Hyland, Dosunmu, Alvarado, Nembhard. Grimes won Thibodeau's trust as a 3D wing and seized the only relatively open starting position in New York. Hyland entered the league in a season when the Nuggets lacked ball-handling development guards, and relied on high ball rights to support his statistics. But it cannot be said that he has landed yet. His playing style and defense determine it. If he does not have a high enough scoring efficiency, he will be a very negative player. Dosunmu seized the opportunity of the Bulls' large number of injuries in the backcourt and secured the rotation with his relatively versatile advantage. He didn't quite land, either, because there was every slight doubt about his omnipotence. Liuye seized the opportunity when the Pelicans lacked the No. 1 position, especially the defensive No. 1 position, and became a unique special player. Nembhard cannot be called to seize the vacancy. Under Carlisle, no matter what the pick is, sooner or later he will have a chance to show himself. Nembhard's season level does not guarantee that he will go ashore, but he has two masterpieces: his incredible performance against the Warriors and his stunning victory over the Lakers. Fans of the two traffic teams should remember him firmly. In general, for young people who can enter the rookie game, ""appropriate opportunities"" are essential prerequisites for them to stand out. Some are trained as the core of the team, some are important puzzle pieces, and there is not much pressure, or Technical characteristics have been given sufficient time when the team is highly scarce. And some seized the team's personnel gaps and fully demonstrated themselves. Those lottery picks who did not enter the rookie game each had their own reasons: Suggs got enough time and ball rights, he just failed to live up to expectations. Fultz has returned, and there is Anthony in the backcourt. There are many young people in the team who can play and hold the ball. The competition Suggs faces has become increasingly fierce, and the time he got is not as good as that of the first grade. But considering Fultz's attendance risk, Suggs is safe for the duration of his rookie contract. His defense and big heart are obvious advantages. Finding a stable offensive method as soon as possible is still very promising. Mitchell Jr. is currently on a playoff team with sufficient backcourt personnel and excellent core rotation attendance. It's normal that he won't get time in his rookie season. He is currently still in the rotation. Zaire Williams was on a playoff team but got plenty of rotation time in first grade. But because I was not ambitious enough, my time this season was drastically reduced. Primo wanted to die on his own, so let’s not talk about it. Duarte had a bright rookie season and became famous early among players in his generation. However, his performance has declined this season. There are other young people competing for the same position, and his opportunities have dropped sharply. Bouknight and Johnny Davis, judging from the games they have played so far, the former is really not good, and the latter shows too little face to be difficult to evaluate. (Both of them have a 40%+ true shooting percentage) The problem with Osman Dieng is that he has many injuries and does not have enough time to perform. There are many competitors for Abaji's position, and he is suppressed by the strength of veterans, but his time has also been added recently. Even though the Pelicans have many rotations, Dyson Daniels still gets opportunities due to the team's injuries. Shaiden Sharp has received rotation time that is completely beyond his level. For a team like the Trail Blazers that pursues winning, this is already a high salary. The Blazers have also seen some bright spots and improvements from him. Among the 21st and 22nd lottery picks, the worst ones were these two brothers: Kuminga. He is an embryo that gives free reign to football rights and needs an environment where he doesn't care about the record at all, but it is obvious that he is not in such a team. In the same pursuit of record, the Trail Blazers are more tolerant to Sharp and the Grizzlies are to Zawei than the Warriors are to Kuminga. The only relief is that now that the Warriors are extremely short of players on the front line, Kuminga has basically maintained his average of 20 minutes per game. Moody's. Although Moody did not perform sufficiently in the limited opportunities, except for Bouknight and Primo, who had off-court problems, Moody was the lottery pick in the same class who got the least opportunities. When he performed well, he didn't get more opportunities because of it. When pulling the crotch, DNP is obtained very stably. The Warriors failed to let him go at the deadline, which was a pity for both parties.

4.88E+15,MvQTDcLX,6087450499,Encore’s five-dimensional pocket,"The Suns played three games after Durant returned. On the one hand, the Suns have fulfilled our expectations. Even in these three running-in periods, they have shown some very fancy tactical coordination, a high offensive ceiling (the offensive efficiency in the last two games is 134 and 137), and an offensive Devin Booker has more space; on the other hand, neither the Hornets nor the Bulls are playoff teams. After the transaction, the Mavericks' defensive level relies on defense. We can also say that they have not encountered any valuable test. . In terms of perception alone, the Suns are one of the average teams at the basket. Durant's help in this regard is relatively limited. After all, Durant himself is no longer able to get to the basket as frequently as before after recovering from injury. . In addition, the decrease in depth will force the Suns to rotate some less high-quality space points, eating up 25-35 minutes of time. In addition, Paul has a tendency to mutate towards pseudo-space points. He has excellent catch-and-shoot efficiency, but the frequency of his shots is too low. His shooting methods and postures are all designed for shooting with the ball. He will often give up some semi-open shots and switch to secondary organization. Or finding rhythm after dribbling. And now he no longer has the athletic ability to score twice after catching the ball and launch the offense to a high level. In the middle and later stages of today's game, the Mavericks turned Durant, Booker, and Ayton's shots into open/semi-open shots from the offensive supporting cast in the corners and at the top of the key. Okogie performed very poorly, and Wainwright Expectations were fulfilled, but Paul only managed to respond to two wide open shots. The Suns will definitely experience this moment a lot in the playoffs. The season is not long, and role players’ three-point shots from the two corners can only be left to mathematics, but Paul is often at the top of the arc. I wonder if Paul, who has never had so many off-ball scenes before, can be as slightly as Harden. Expand the shooting range, stand one step outside the three-point line, and complete a farther shot, or use a small forward step to catch the ball to gain momentum and an opportunity to destroy the opponent's center of gravity to help your old leg break through. But even if Okogie is no longer 0 for 8, this is definitely not the way the Suns want to end the offense. No one wants to be forced by the defense to change the offensive mode. The Suns need to practice a type of tactic, which appeared in the first quarter of KD's comeback - Paul holds the ball at a 40-degree angle on one side, and Durant comes up to cover. This is a pick-and-roll that can create mismatches and also allow Durant to Get open opportunities to cut inside and bounce out, Ayton and Okogie set a screen at the other end of the court, Booker comes out to go around the screen for a three-pointer, or does a pull-up mid-range with less dribbling - everyone is there A more comfortable offensive role (P1). Or some more complex pick-and-roll games - Ayton moves to the top of the key, Paul hands over, KD/Booker lifts from the baseline, Paul goes to set an off-ball screen for those chasing them, and then lets Ayton and their hands Hand over (P2). KD may be the star most suitable for dynamic offense in the history of basketball. He wants the ball with his back at the waist and then singles out in the mid-range, or plays a simple and dull pick-and-roll with the ball at 40 degrees. This is definitely not his destiny. The Suns don't have the space environment of the Mavericks and Bucks, so the game must flow. Coach Monty once planned the most complicated pick-and-roll changes in the league, but it was completed by the still-living point guard god. At that time, the two players other than Booker were Crowder and Bridges-both Ability to punish when opportunities arise. Now he faces a new challenge - how can he get everyone involved in the offense when Okogie is firmly left open and Paul is old and has to hibernate as a shooter, handoff player, and screener? Anyway, it can’t be as simple as P3. The deeper the round, the more super help defenders will have enough mobility to step on the three-point line and control Paul and the corners at the same time. Imagine replacing Doncic in that position with Dream Chaser or letter? What a nightmare. When this hellish scene occurs, Paul will definitely take the blame in this series. Another rather darkly humorous thing is that the sun is so strong in the middle distance that it overflows. The mid-range is regarded as a punitive method in modern basketball that does not allow role players to take shots and superstars cannot advance to the basket. It is mainly used to support production. Many teams don't even set up mid-range defenses and force their opponents to take a mid-range shot, which is considered a defensive success. On this basis, Durant, Booker and Paul became popular with their high shooting percentages. But some opponents - such as tonight's Mavericks - they have average rotations, extremely poor body shape, and help defenders with little athletic ability. They can hardly guard any team and rely solely on super offense to support them. Many teams can defeat their defense with air cuts and sudden three-pointers. It will not be reduced to testing the mid-range of the star players. Facing this kind of opponent, it is Booker who increases the role of attacking the frame, and Durant will never be able to shoot a mid-range shot with a 70% hit rate. Can the Suns win the championship? I don't quite believe it. Because of the old talk of health - when they meet teams like the Grizzlies and Celtics that are young, impactful, love to fight and put pressure on the ball, if the series reaches the fourth or fifth game, Paul and Du When Rand announced his withdrawal, the team had no right to shout to the sky and say, ""This is completely unlucky and there is absolutely no reason for this to happen."" They have such hidden dangers. Because championship-level defensive rotations, key execution, and offensive tactics all take time to adjust - Monty is a coach who likes to let the stars play at the same time instead of staggering them as much as possible, so as to harvest chemical reactions in a steady stream. It is difficult for a team to do this in less than twenty regular season games. And they may encounter strong opponents in the first round. Because in the entire history of the NBA, since the merger of the ABA and NBA, there has never been a halfway deal to win the championship for the actual boss team. But Kevin Durant is, after all, the most compatible star in history, and expectations for him to break history can always be open.",,,,,5,35,216,3/6/23 9:11,iPhone 12 Pro Max,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/006DYjXtgy1hbpvc79w1mj31nr0ua100.jpg', 'https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/006DYjXtgy1hbpvc6xfaaj30zb0j30vm.jpg', 'https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/ 006DYjXtgy1hbpvc7x0r5j31qo0soal7.jpg']",,

4.87E+15,MtsaW1eRQ,5104872102,A certain Zhang Jiawei,"On February 17, 1963, Michael Jordan was born. His father, James Jordan, believed in getting rich through hard work; he started out as a forklift worker and gradually became a machinist, shipper, and finally department manager. He has always instilled in his sons that nothing in this world comes out of thin air. In 1981, 18-year-old Michael Jordan graduated from Laney High School in Wilmington, North Carolina, failing to rank among the top 300 best basketball players in high school. My family wrote to UCLA, a super-prestigious school, to apply for a basketball scholarship, but received no response. The University of Virginia was more polite and sent me an application form for an ordinary student—forget about the scholarship. The Jordan family went to the University of North Carolina. Roy Williams, the assistant coach of North Carolina at the time and later the legendary coach, came to see him. He went back and said to his colleague Eddie Fogler: ""I saw all the high school players who are 193 centimeters tall."" The best one... Michael Jordan, a kid from Wilmington."" Jordan then entered North Carolina. When Jordan was a freshman in 1982, he defeated Georgetown and allowed North Carolina to win the national championship, but that year he was only the team's third-leading scorer: he was a freshman after all. As a sophomore, he averaged 20 points and 6 rebounds per game, making him the first team in the United States; as a junior year, he averaged 20 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 steals and 1 block, shooting 55% from the field. Together with Perkins, he led North Carolina to 28 wins and 3 losses. He won almost all the annual college awards. Later in the Olympics, he led the US team to win the championship as a college player. But in the 1984 draft, the Houston Rockets selected the University of Houston's big dream. The Portland Trail Blazers selected Kentucky's Sam Bowie. Jordan is just the third overall pick. In his rookie year in the 1984-85 season, Jordan averaged 28.2 points per game, ranked third in the league, and ranked first in the NBA in total points throughout the season. He averaged 28+7+6+2+1 per game and shot 52% from the field. Such beautiful data, but the second team of the NBA ——The first-team guards are a magician averaging 18+6+13 and an assassin averaging 21+5+14. Newcomers, hold back if you don’t accept it. In his second year, due to a serious foot injury, Jordan only appeared in 18 regular season games. In the playoffs, against the Celtics, who had the league's best defense and 67 wins in the regular season, Jordan scored 49 points in the first game. Dennis Johnson, one of the most outstanding perimeter defenders in history and the 1979 Finals MVP, stared at the data table in a daze after the game and said to his teammate Sichting: ""Fortunately, Michael will not do this again."" Jordan scored a playoff record 63 points in Game 2. Bird said, ""God wore No. 23."" In his third grade, Jordan averaged 37.1 points per game. Only Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor have done something similar in history. From then on, Jordan began his mighty journey to become the scoring champion, and from then on he began to become the king of the NBA in all advanced statistics. But the media also criticized him for not being good defensively. In his fourth grade, Jordan won the Defensive Player of the Year + Regular Season MVP + Scoring Champion. But the media said he wasn't going to win. Until 1990, when he won his fourth consecutive scoring title and monopolized the annual first-team and defensive lineups, the media still said that he was not as good as Magic and Bird: he only had personal performance and could not lead the team to win. Very cruel, right? This is the NBA. Before 1991, any media with brains recognized Jordan as the best player on both offense and defense, but always said that he was not as selfless and suitable as a leader as Bird and Magic. In short, Jordan was better than Magic and Bird. The difference lies in ""being able to win"". Although even Magic himself said: ""Basketball is divided into Michael and the rest of us."" In the 1991 Finals, after Jordan averaged 31 points per game and provided 57 assists in five games to lead the team to the championship, he had no choice. In the summer of 1991, Jordan won his second regular season MVP, fifth scoring champion, first championship, and first Finals MVP. At the end of the year, some media began to discuss that Jordan was the best player in history. It’s not the achievement, it’s the skill. In the winter of 1991, the media made a big summary. Jordan's long-range shot was not as good as Bird's, but his mid-range shot was comparable to Bird's - Bird was considered the GOAT in shooting at the time. Jordan's 57 assists in five games in the 1991 Finals proved that he was already one of the best passers in the world: In the 1991 Finals, the Magic opposite Jordan had 62 assists in five games, but he retired in the summer of 1991 . Not to mention scoring with and without the ball, rebounding and defense. Jordan was praised for two other things. The first is that ""Every game and every possession of Jordan's game is as if he is playing his last basketball."" That is the statement of Doc Rivers, the assist leader in Atlanta team history, who we are now very familiar with. The second is: ""Michael...he is the best. I grew up with Connie Hawkins, I saw Dr. J at his peak, I saw David Skywalker Thompson score 73 points in a single game, I love Magic and Bird, but Michael... I'm willing to pay to watch him play. I'm even willing to pay to watch him train."" This is Popovich's teacher, Iverson's happy enemy, who led the Pistons to win the championship in 2004. The exact words of Larry Brown, the most demanding coach in the history of the NBA who is picky about details and hates individual talent performances the most. You have to know how disgusted Brown is with personal talent to understand how sincere his words to Jordan are. In 1992, Jordan won the MVP title with 67 wins and led the team to win the championship. Three consecutive championships in 1993. So far, the seven scoring titles are tied with Chamberlain's history, the three regular season MVPs are tied with Bird and Magic, and the three consecutive championships are the only one seen after Russell. In the 1993 Finals, the team averaged 41 points per game to win the championship, which is an unprecedented record so far, and it was also the third consecutive championship. In 1992, Jordan became the first player to win consecutive Finals MVP awards. In 1993, he became the first player to win three consecutive Finals MVPs. It would be difficult for others to win the title for the third time in a row! So far, the only three consecutive Finals MVPs are Jordan and Shaq. So famous people began to say that he was the number one in history. ""It's okay for me to say Jordan is the number one. Bill Russell won all the championships (11 times), you can't deny it, but if you just talk about the game itself, you have to say, Michael is the best. This Guy has won numerous scoring titles and is one of the best defensive players in history. That's it."" - This was said by Willie, the great center who led New York to the championship twice in 1970 and 1973 and the first player in the history of the New York Knicks. S Reed. ""Michael's talent is above all others. Russell is the most efficient center I have ever seen, and he complements all the talents our team needs. But you can say, for example, that he doesn't shoot well. Michael doesn't have that kind of shortcoming."" - Russell's own teammate, Bob Cousy, the seven-time assist champion and the originator of point guards, said this. ""Oscar's defense is only outstanding when he is willing to defend with heart; Michael is as cruel as Australia's big-mouthed Tasmanian devil. God only created one Michael."" - The Bulls' own assistant coach Bach said this. Dominic Wilkins' conclusion is unequivocal: ""No one can do it better than Michael!"" In 1993, Jordan had already received widespread praise from Goat. Then he went to play baseball. Then came back. In 1996, the Bulls won a then-record 72 games. Jordan was 33 years old, his fourth regular season MVP, and his eighth scoring champion. The Bulls won the 1996 championship and had a total of 100 games and 87 wins throughout the regular season and playoffs. Another pile of records. The 1996-97 season coincided with the 50th anniversary of the NBA. The Bulls were leading the league again, and finally set the second-highest regular season record in history with 69 wins. Anyone who has experienced the media atmosphere that year knows: everyone is talking lively and saying that Jordan is the number one in history. Only Chamberlain routinely boasted during the 1997 All-Star Game. Winning the championship in 1997 and getting the fifth ring was important, but more important was the process. In the first game of the finals, Jordan took advantage of ""the postman is not working on Sunday"" to complete the decisive victory. In the fifth game, the flugame was too legendary. Jordan won the battle of Tianwang Mountain despite being ill. Two classic examples in one series, including Cole's key assist in Game 6, have become the legend of Cole's career. At this point, everyone has reached a tacit understanding and can't find any reason why he is not a goat. Come to the 1997-98 season. The previous year the Bulls won the championship with 69 wins in the regular season, but the team's third scorer only scored 754 points in the entire regular season. In other words, this team's scoring depends entirely on its two leaders, Jordan and Pippen. The 32-year-old second-in-command also injured his back, was having trouble, and planned to leave. In the 1997-98 season, the Bulls' starting lineup consisted of two 35-year-old guards, a 37-year-old forward, and two 30-year-old seniors. The two best young men on the bench are two forwards who were drafted at No. 20 when they entered the industry, but failed to produce any results no matter how hard they played. Scores in the opening series of games: 85, 94, 87 (87 points in double overtime!), 94, 78, 99, 80, 83... In the first month of the season, the Bulls had 8 wins and 7 losses. Slow tempo, few free throws. Live by rebounding, perimeter pressure and passing movement. Their manager clearly wants to tear the team apart. The boss does not plan to give the head coach a new contract. Just stumbling around. At the end of the season, the team's second leading scorer scored 984 points. But it doesn't matter: after the Bulls started with 8 wins and 7 losses, they went 54 wins and 13 losses in the second half. Jordan himself scored 2,357 points in the season. They made it through the first two rounds of the playoffs, losing only one game. Then they played seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals: That opponent, the Indiana Pacers, has reached the Eastern Conference Finals five times in seven years, and will reach the Finals in two years. In Game 7, this team only shot 38% from the field and still won. why? The team's two aces, who are 68 years old together, grabbed 11 offensive rebounds and made 24 free throws. They were able to win through physical combat. Really out of ammunition and food. So they immediately lost the first game of the finals: physical fitness, away games, everything bottomed out. But then they took the lead to 3-1, lost the fifth game, and then came the legendary sixth game in 1998. Jordan scored 45 of the Bulls' 87 points in the final game of the Finals. Sixth championship. Second three consecutive championships. Second consecutive Finals MVP. The 35-year-old Jordan averaged 34 points per game in the 1998 Finals with a low score of 88 to 80. In the last game, he scored 45 of the team's 87 points. In the last minute, he scored a layup, a steal and a steal. Killing jump shots is done by oneself without any teammates. In the three years between the ages of 33 and 35, Jordan won 72 games in a row and 69 in a row. He also won six championships with consecutive buzzer-beaters and flugames in the finals. Miracles one after another. The second three consecutive championships. Nothing in this world comes out of nowhere. A high school student that neither UCLA nor Virginia wanted. The third player in North Carolina's first championship. Winning all-American college awards is still just the third best. In his rookie year, he ranked first in the league in scoring but could only make the second team. This is the starting point. How did Jordan do it? The second-year media suspected that he would never play again after suffering a fracture. He scored 49 points in a single game and then scored 63 points in a row. In the third grade, everyone asked whether he was as good at defense as he was offensively. He blocked Dantley against the Pistons, and in his fourth grade he won the Defensive Player of the Year and MVP. Everyone doubted that he couldn't get past the Pistons and was not as good as Magic and Bird in winning games. In 1991, he swept the Pistons and defeated Magic to win the championship. Then he won three consecutive championships proving that he could win better than Magic and Bird. After playing baseball, everyone questioned whether he could still control the league. He won a record 72 games and won the championship. In 1997, Postman won the regular season MVP. He defeated Postman and won the championship despite being sick. Everyone questioned whether he relied on Pippen. He led an old team to first place in the Eastern Conference while Pippen was recovering from injury, and finally won the sixth championship with a buzzer-beater. In the 1990s, he won the championship and won the Finals MVP in all full seasons. He won four regular season MVPs in six championships - in 1993 and 1997, he did not win the regular season MVP. He defeated the regular season MVP in the finals both times to prove his talent. It's the king. What if there was no Jordan? Postman is likely to be a three-time regular season MVP, five-time scoring champion and two more championships, directly overpowering Dream. Bird and Magic each have four regular season MVPs, tying with LeBron, and Magic will tie with LeBron with six rings. The glider will have a regular season MVP and a finals MVP. There will be two regular season MVPs. Barkley will have a regular season MVP and a finals MVP. Peyton and Rainman, or Shark and Penny, would have a ring. All of the above could have reached a higher level of honor, but they were all beaten to what they are now by Jordan. Jordan dominated an era, beating all his contemporary opponents to the next level. After Jordan himself won his first MVP and first Defensive Player of the Year in 1988, he had become the actual number one player in the NBA at that time. But he still has to win his first championship to truly surpass Magic and Bird. It takes three championships to be recognized by the celebrities as being able to compete for the top spot in history. Winning 72 wins and the fourth championship, but still being criticized by Chamberlain; winning the fifth championship despite being sick, and then the sixth championship at the age of 35. In Game 6 of the 1998 Finals, with 41.9 seconds left, the Bulls kicked off. Jordan dribbled to the right wing and faced Brian Russell. He paused for a moment, then suddenly lowered his body, started to speed up, and used the remaining strength of his legs - the legs that once flew into the sky - to burst out the last bit of energy, dodge Russell, hold the ball firmly, and step over Step: A most unpretentious layup on the board. The 43rd point of the game. Bulls 85 to 86. There are 37.1 seconds left. Jazz baseline kickoff. Stockton dribbled to the left wing. Karl Malone struggled with Rodman at the right midfielder, while Jordan guarded the sharpshooter Hornacek. The postman and Hornacek made a cross screen, showing off the muscles of running against the wind with a parachute on his back, squeezed to the left waist, and Rodman followed closely. Hornacek ran to the right wing, trying to take Jordan away. But when Hornacek turned around, he realized that Jordan had not followed. The postman didn't see Jordan's gamble. He received Stockton's pass and thought Hornacek had taken away Jordan. He didn't notice a dark shadow lurking from behind. Then he realized that the ball had been patted: Jordan and Rodman double-teamed the mailman and intercepted the ball. Still 85 to 86. Bulls possession. Jordan didn't fake the ball to anyone. He dribbled the ball alone across half court and stood on the left side of the frontcourt. 14 seconds left. He dribbles the ball, looks at the rim, and waits for Brian Russell to come tag him. With 10 seconds left, Jordan started. Russell stuck to Jordan, Jordan dribbled the ball with his right hand straight to the three-point line, and then, suddenly, made a sharp stop. Stepping back from the brink. Russell was caught off guard and knocked down by Jordan. He still had time to look up: Jordan collected the ball, and there was no one marking him in the open space, with 7.5 seconds left. Jordan started. The purest, most basic, no-gimmick mid-range shot. For two seconds, his right hand stood high in the air. Then the ball went in. Personal 45th point. The Bulls lead 87 to 86. Stockton missed a long shot and the Bulls won their second three consecutive championships and their sixth championship. ——The above paragraph is excerpted from my book ""The Eight Parts of the Heavenly Dragon"". Elder Zhiguang once said this to Qiao Feng: ""He tries you three major problems, and you solve them one by one, but you still have to wait until you reach the end."" After achieving seven major merits, he gave him the dog-beating stick. That year at the Taishan Conference, you defeated nine powerful enemies of the Beggar Clan, making the Beggar Clan powerful in the world. At that time, he had no room for hesitation before appointing you. As the leader of the Beggar Clan. As far as I know, there has never been a second leader of the Beggar Clan for hundreds of years, and it was as difficult as yours."" The 1998 championship said. This is the second three consecutive championships. Six championships. An entire career. Nothing in this world comes out of nowhere. This position was never won by anyone, it was earned by Jordan himself through all the obstacles. In December 1984, 21 years and 10 months old, Jordan was asked how his career would end. He replied: ""I hope I can say then that I have tried my best, accomplished many things, and won the championship."" Then he thought about it - he had no idea at that time how great he would be in the future. As for his career, he just thought about his wishes and added: ""I hope that I can play in at least one All-Star Game."" This is where his magnificent career started. Michael Jordan turns 60 today. #jordan#",,,,Jordan,334,137,1266,2/17/23 18:20,Weibo web version,['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/005ztwqOgy1hb6nnepzucj30zk0k0q9b.jpg'],,
4.87E+15,MtqBopkcu,6884010939,Football Storytelling,"If Westbrook is bought out in the NBA, is it feasible to join the Warriors? There is talk about whether Westbrook joining the Warriors will lead to the finale of the league. I think we can give it a try. If the Warriors have enough space for Westbrook to not get over the top, they can burst or shoot. Now that Payton can't come, Westbrook should be the most cost-effective option. Although he may not understand the tactics, you can arrange some off-ball corner or inside tactics for him, or let him eat the ball and lead shooters. This is what he is good at. It depends on whether Westbrook is willing to buy out and lose money. Even if he buys out, I think joining the Clippers is more likely. After all, they are all in Los Angeles.

The efficiency is not very high, but from attacking the space to defensively blocking letters and protecting rebounds, Muscala has proven that he is a very high-quality rotation center. In his first three games in Boston, he hit double figures in all of them and hit multiple three-pointers in each game. In the past three years with the Thunder, Muscala has never played more than 31 minutes in a single game. He has never played more than 39 minutes in a single game in his career.

4.87E+15,MsRv75n1Q,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Let’s talk about the buyout market] Let’s talk about the buyout market. The players who have been confirmed to enter the buyout market include: Backcourt: Beverley, Reggie Jackson, Forbes, Wall Wing & Forward: Danny Green, Terrence Ross, Stanley Johnson, Justin Jackson , Greg Brown Inside: Bitadze, Ibaka, Dedmon, Noel Players who may enter the buyout market are: Backcourt: Westbrook, Barton Wing & Forward: Justin Holiday Inside: Love has Among the players who have bought out, Terrence Ross, Reggie Jackson, and Danny Green have chosen to join the Suns, Nuggets, and Cavaliers. Terrence Ross is more of an icing on the cake. There aren't many options in the buyout market. If a wing with a good combination of shooting skills and size appears, it won't be a loss if you can sign him and give him a try. The Suns sent away Bridge, Crowder and Johnson. They still have Durant, Craig and TJ Warren on the forward line, Okogie, Damian Lee and Shamet on the wings, and they also got Baez. Li, Wainwright has a two-way contract. The Suns are not lacking in wing depth, but since there are still spots available, as long as you don't mind spending money, it's not a bad thing to stock up on one more person. The Suns currently have wings and forwards, and the biggest question is the reliability of others below Durant. Can Craig and Okogie's offense hold up in the postseason? This question is basically negative for Bazley. Warren does not occupy 3D, and provides more depth protection. When Durant is healthy, his significance is not as good as standard 3D. Li is very useful, but Brother Li's talent lies here, and he can only be used as a special role to fill in the transition period. Shamet is just more expensive than Brother Li. The Suns have depth on the wings and forwards, but the absolute strength of the second, third, and fourth players at this position is insufficient. Rose can't solve this problem, but he can give Monty one more choice. In the past, he played a super-six role in the Magic. He is a shooter with development ability. His talent is better than that of Lee and Shamet. His body type is closer to the wing than the backcourt. He can be regarded as a Suns wing with a relatively good combination of shooting and height. one. The question for Rose is whether he can achieve ""refined efficiency"" in a smaller role with the Suns? Rose's advantage has always been his ability to develop jump shots regardless of the environment. For a team with Durant, Booker, and Paul, this ability has almost no strategic significance. He needs to optimize his shot selection and deliver less but better shots. Just take action. Reggie Jackson and the Nuggets took Reggie and they sent Hyland away, which formed an interesting back and forth. It was equivalent to the Clippers and Nuggets exchanging their respective XJBD backup guards. It's understandable for the Nuggets to sign a guard. Although Hylander's style of play is a bit incompatible with the Nuggets' style, after all, his possession rate is as high as 27.4%, and someone must take the large amount of ball rights that are absorbed. Except for Murray, the Nuggets actually don't have such a player in the backcourt. Veteran Ismael Smith is more suitable for the role on the edge of the bench. After the Nuggets introduced substitute center Bryant, they hope to transform the offense of the substitute lineup into a two-man switch style at the 1st and 5th positions. In particular, if the Nuggets want to put the starting lineup together for enough time to establish dominance, the bench needs a more energetic No. 1 position to lead the ten minutes of the transition period with Bryant, rather than letting Bryant Malone is too nerve-wracking to mix lineups. Is there such a point guard on the market? Yes, and he is familiar with Bryant's game. There are two questions: First, Westbrook has not confirmed the buyout; second, is Westbrook willing to accept 15 minutes of play in each game? These 15 minutes may seem small, but they will be completely dominated by him. The Nuggets chose Reggie. I can't tell what effect the combination of him and Bryant will have. Reggie's advantage is that in a lineup with a starting lineup and a bench, he has a better off-ball role. He can play next to Teacher Yue and then leave the mopping task to Murray. The expectation for Reggie is that he can shoot well at fixed spots and then be efficient in a small amount of simple possessions. The most perfect result is to deliver a performance close to the 2021 playoffs. Although the hope is not high, he has such experience after all, and the probability is higher than expecting Hyland to suddenly become enlightened. On the defensive end, Reggie will also be more reliable than Hyland. Danny Green only cares about positioning, and Danny Green is exactly what the Cavaliers dream of. The Cavaliers have always been troubled by the lack of 3D in the 2nd and 3rd positions. After studding Mitchell, the Cavaliers' bargaining chips are no longer able to ask for such reinforcements in the trading market. This is why the Cavaliers are the only team that has not made any moves at the trade deadline. Danny Green appears on the buyout market, and the Cavaliers must of course be the first to rush over. For Tielin, the Cavaliers are indeed one of the playoff teams most likely to give him enough time. Danny Green only played 3 games after his comeback. With the injuries he suffered, it will definitely take some time to find his form. The home team Grizzlies actually need this type of player in case Dillon commits too many fouls and ends up watching the show on the bench. Being so anxious to send Tielin away, it can only be said that for the Grizzlies, who are also in urgent need of wing projection resources, they cannot wait for an uncertain result, and Tielin is the only contract they are willing to give away in the Kennard trade. . There are several other players who are confirmed to be bought out or who may be bought out, and they deserve special attention. Beverley failed to fulfill his expectations in the Lakers. His amazing comprehensive offensive and defensive performance in the Timberwolves declined to varying degrees in the Lakers. But Gou Ge's energy still has room to be released. His biting ability and defensive experience are of certain value to the playoff team. The only question is how to make good use of his offense. Although Beverley is not a very stable space player, he can maintain a three-point shooting rate of about 40% in most seasons of his career. He just did not shoot well with the Timberwolves and Lakers. Beverley has assumed a larger ball-handling role in the Timberwolves, and there was even a ball-handling system specially designed for him to target Morant in the playoffs, which to a certain extent made up for the decline in three-point shooting. The Lakers are in a situation where the ball is not enough to score points. They just stand at a certain point. Beverley has no additional contribution, and it is very fatal if the shots are not accurate enough. Beverley's front rebound rate has also dropped to less than half of last season, let alone compared with when he was young. As we age, it is inevitable that our athletic ability and competitive energy will decline. However, he also had an unforgettable putback dunk in the yellow-green battle, which may prove that there is still room for redemption in terms of rebounding performance. For a team that needs a perimeter leader and a versatile wing, Beverley is a player worth trying. The reason why it is called ""wing"" rather than backcourt is because Beverley does not provide the main offensive skills usually required in the backcourt, but his matchup ability is better than that of the average backcourt, and he can compete with players much taller than him. fight. This is similar to Payton. Stanley Johnson Stanley Johnson is one of the few forwards on the buyout market who is physically strong and can defend. He has excellent defensive flexibility and can even support an inside line. Teams that have owned him will recognize this. Stanley Johnson's main problem is his offense. He does not have a particularly outstanding offensive method. This season, Stanley Johnson's three-pointers are very accurate, but he only took 40 shots in total. The sample is very small, and his career three-point shooting rate is 30.5%. In terms of dribbling, passing, finishing, and shooting, Stanley Johnson is half-assed. As a striker, his positioning is difficult. As an inside line, he is a helpless choice for teams with extremely small lineups. His highlight was last season against the Jazz, when he defeated Gobert who was facing him in the fourth quarter. In that game, his breakthroughs, mid-range shots, and even reverse pick-and-rolls were all in good shape, and he responded to the center's recycling defensive methods in various ways. This state should be the most ideal result for his next club. Stanley Johnson was one of the bargaining chips that the Lakers used to trade for Beverley, and now the two of them have become competitors in the buyout market for 3D characters. The choice between these two people depends on which of the following possibilities you believe in and like more: A. An experienced veteran who has proven himself, in the right position, can return to a level closer to expectations and deliver top-notch performances Lead the defense and make multiple comprehensive contributions on the offensive end. An environment where everyone touches the ball may be necessary; B. A weighty edge forward who has been trying to prove himself. It is expected that he can stabilize the three-point shooting rate in a small sample and deliver flexible forward defense. This is my evaluation of Westbrook's current ability: He is not suitable to be a starter for any playoff team, let alone a key player. After only playing 15 to 20 minutes, Westbrook is still better than many teams' backup point guards. Better; there must be a tacit understanding between the coach and Westbrook at any time. Westbrook's biggest advantage is his ""unlimited ability to develop offensive energy."" He can't lead an exquisite, high-level offensive team, but he won't let you go back and forth for a long time for a shooting opportunity to no avail. After all, he has the passive attribute of naturally getting open jump shots. I mean, Westbrook has little need for Jigsaw to be able to make plays, screens, or even chemistry. Playing with him, there is no point in tossing hand-offs at the top of the arc. If there are big men who can catch the ball and finish near the basket and shooters lying in wait on the outside, Westbrook can lead him. Take the Clippers as an example. It will be very difficult for them to play Westbrook in the final lineup because opponents will use centers to defend him, which eliminates the Clippers' original space advantage of five players. But during the transition period, opponents may not have strong enough rim protection resources to attack Westbrook like this. When Westbrook and Zubac team up, they can feed the latter the ball, or provide the ball to George and Powell who are out of pocket. These are all conceivable scenes. What the Clippers are afraid of is that Westbrook also has the problems that Wall has. What the Clippers can think on the bright side is that with the same functionality, Westbrook's degree of completion will be higher. Judging from the Clippers' operational logic, they seem to be determined to enter the playoffs without a real point guard, and space threats are almost their minimum requirement for non-center rotations. If the management is determined on such a team-building strategy, then George's promotion will be meaningless. If he has to convince the management to pursue Westbrook, George needs to ensure that he can convince Westbrook to play a role that plays 15 minutes per game, has no key ball time, and may be DNP at any time due to the opponent's targeting. I don’t know if George can express this humiliating condition. Justin Holiday is a 3D wing with the right positioning but insufficient ability. For teams with extremely low functional requirements for puzzles, you can try it. The Mavericks are interesting to him, probably because they can indeed accept Jigsaw playing a very pure role. This is one of the few opportunities for Holiday to save his career. Insider Ibaka is too old, and his true age is difficult to guess. That means his combat power is limited, and teams in the playoffs cannot expect him. Than Taze is more suitable for teams trying to ""second draft"" lottery tickets. Dedmon has a large body and is suitable as a third center who is positioned as a back-off position. He should be held with a yes-no attitude. Noel still has the defensive ability of a small ball center, and those who are looking forward to the value on this end can buy him. It is reasonable for the 76ers to be interested in him. Noel's offense is very poor and Harden's feeding ability is needed to try to save it. His defensive ability can differentiate him from other backup centers of the 76ers, giving Rivers room to choose. Love has declined greatly this season. Maybe there is room for rebound in form and he can become a special weapon that lasts more than 10 minutes in the transition period. But there are also questions about whether he is sure to enter the buyout market. The Cavaliers are not short of spots. If Love hadn't asked for it, it might not be too bad to continue to hold him.

Jovan Buha said: ""My concern with this starting lineup is that with this arrangement, there will be only one shooter next to James.

(The following is the original text of this fan) After watching the young master play for the Lakers for two years, I am really close to the third grade. First, let’s talk about the young master. Impression in the eyes of many people: Fierce play, fierce attack to the basket, triple-double king, able to assist with the ball. Real young master: Can't play off-ball defense. Ranked among the bottom 10 in the league in offense. Second-to-last in the league in offensive frame shooting rate of 50% and often. After letting go and being blocked, he counterattacked and attacked the frame. After being fouled, he often made 2-for-0 free throws. The shooting ability of the ice shooter. Check out the shooting heat map for yourself. Smashing the timer with air balls is common. He took the ball and stood outside the three-point line. The opponent completely let it go and let it go three meters away. , the opponent's defense directly shrinks the inside, double-teams James or has thick eyebrows to cause 4-on-5. The young master's ability to break through and assist is still there, but his passes are often too outrageous and there are so many unforced errors. At that moment, it is difficult for people to think that he is a player. An NBA player whose blood pressure rises immediately after watching too much. The only thing left for the young master is that his style of play is still great. It is not unreasonable for him to go from the league's maximum salary to being bought out. Statistics such as 2 for 16 can hardly reflect the damage he has done to the team.

4.87E+15,Mswx1ira1,2541959385,Ah Shun talks about the ballSean,"From the perspective of the Suns, how to view Durant's deal to join the Suns? I will divide the following content into four parts, namely: offense, defense, pertinence, and future layout. 1. Offensive The Suns are originally one of the best mid-range teams in the league. Booker, Ayton and Paul are all the top mid-range jumpers in the league. They have all delivered great success in the mid-range in the past few seasons. Proportion and scoring efficiency, and in recent seasons Durant has been called the best mid-range jumper in the tracking data era. Durant's joining has made the Suns the easiest team in the league to develop offense. There was no such team before. It is the Nets with the Big Three. In Durant's first season back, the Nets were a one-on-one team with excellent space. They had the best point guards, wings and forwards in the league since the new century. Therefore, the Nets' offense became more and more complex. It's extremely easy. As long as the Big Three dribble the ball across the half court, they can start the one-on-one game. Therefore, even if Harden, Irving, and Durant rarely play together in the regular season, the Nets still have the highest offensive efficiency in history. In the Suns, Booker's one-on-one level is excellent but not top-notch at all. At this age, Paul basically has no one-on-one ability, and the team's current space is not absolutely top-notch (the fifth starter is likely to be Craig. Paul's ability to catch and shoot three-pointers and his habits without the ball have also been relatively long-term. (Poor). At that time, the Nets had many shooters and also had shooters like Jeff Green and Griffin at the 5th position. Therefore, it was absolutely impossible for the Suns to use the Nets' brainless method to create the best offense in the league. The Suns' offense theoretically relies more on pick-and-rolls and off-ball movement. The biggest change that Monty Williams brought to the Suns' offense is that the ball is always flowing. Role players, whether it is Crowder, Ohashi or Cameron Johnson, have very good awareness of moving without the ball. Similarly, Durant has always been good at completing offenses without the ball and receiving the ball. I have a relatively optimistic attitude towards integrating into the Suns' offensive system. Similarly, Durant's excellent one-on-one ability can use his personal ability to solve problems when the overall system cannot run. This is a serious problem exposed by the Suns in the game against the Mavericks last year. Once Booker is in good condition, Not at their best, the Suns essentially lack someone who can open up the situation with their personal abilities. At the same time, Durant will not encounter a team with excellent wing depth like the Celtics in the playoffs. Most teams in the Western Conference championship group do not have the resources of the Celtics to limit Durant. After Durant joined the Suns, the player who was most affected was Booker. Let’s talk about Booker first. After Monty came to the Suns, he used various cover tactics such as Spanish pick-and-rolls to give Booker a better position to catch the ball and initiate attacks. This can avoid to the greatest extent his lack of basic ball control skills and passing vision. Narrow short board. Then the key point that determines the quality of Booker's reception is the quality of cover. Because of Crowder's thick body and background as a role player, his willingness and ability to provide screens are much stronger than Durant. After Durant joined, Booker He may be forced to play more one-on-one situations with the ball, and his technical shortcomings may be exposed in the playoffs. If Durant and Booker's playing style is similar to Durant Irving of the Nets, then it will basically be difficult for Booker to play Irving's one-on-one destructive power on the offensive end. For Paul and Ayton, Paul may become a seemingly dispensable figure on the offensive end in just one step, and the player most affected by Paul is obviously Ayton. Ayton, as the league's ceiling figure among non-All-Star players, is a pure finisher. What he needs most is the ball feeding from high-level guards. Obviously, Durant and Booker, who will have the largest share of the ball in the future, are both capable of passing. Unable to compare with Paul, Durant's addition also deprived Ayton of the opportunity to show off his main offense during Booker's absence this year. I think if we compare the Nets without Simmons last year to the current Suns offense, I think the combination of Booker + Durant is not as good as the combination of Irving + Durant. Ayton is definitely better than Zhao Si and Zhuang Shen. Regg's level may not be as good as Brown's. How you view the Suns' offense will depend on how you view the value of the senior 58. My opinion is that the Suns' offense is slightly stronger than the Duo Nets after Irving became full-time last year. Of course, the core advantage still lies in the coach. The Suns' regular season efficiency last year was third in the league. I think Durant's addition can bring the Suns' offense back to last year's level, but it will be difficult to produce a league T0-level offense similar to this year's Nuggets and 20-21 Nets. In the Western Conference playoffs, Durant has the ability to prevent the Suns from the tragedy in the last two games of last year's Western Conference semifinals. # Durant joins the sun##Durant was traded to the sun##2023NBA trading deadline#",,,,"Durant joins the Suns, Durant is traded to the Suns, 2023 NBA trade deadline",0,5,21,2/11/23 15:35,Weibo web version,,,

4.87E+15,MsoTVwK9s,6748483996,Qiu Mo Austin,"Regarding the Grizzlies trade for Kennard, the Grizzlies got: Danny Green + 3rd round. The Grizzlies got: Luke Kennard. Although neither OG nor Ohashi came, I can give this operation an A+ rating. Green lay out for half a season and did not enter a game role on the court after his return. He is rusty after not playing for too long, and the limitations of a single-function shooter make him no better than Konchar. Since Green was considered a future trade bargaining chip during the offseason, it is certainly an excellent move to exchange three useless second-rounders for Kennard, who has a small contract and better combat ability in his early years. . Kennard is undoubtedly one of the best three-point shooters in the league. He has a beautiful and stable three-point resume. He took 6.6 three-pointers in 36 minutes this season and hit 44.7%. Together with Bain, he forms the league's most accurate team. Rotation of position two. If you want to know how lacking the Grizzlies' three-point ability is, or how low the offensive floor is when the level of turnovers drops and the three-point shot cannot be made, you can just look for a game after the Year of the Rabbit and you will know at a glance. 23 Kennard ranks ninth in the league in fixed-point scoring rate, 52% of corner three-pointers, 44% of non-corner three-pointers, 39% of wide-open three-pointers, and 48% of catch-and-shoot three-pointers, regardless of positional battle (the Grizzlies hate it the most) (and not good at) running three-point tactics, or simply standing outside the three-point line, his offensive space bonus to the Nemo Pheasant dual-core can be expected, which is a timely help. At the same time, the Grizzlies are the worst free throw shooting team in the league, and Kennard is a reliable free throw shooter in 87% of his career and 95% of his season. At critical moments, there is one more option to play and hit free throws stably. The biggest concern for Kennard is defense, but I think that's overstated. His current DEPM is -1.4, ranking 62nd among 73 wing players; DLEBRON is 0.0, ranking 33rd among wing players. If you think these two integrated statistics are too different, according to CTG data, when Kennard is on the court this season, the Clippers have lost 7.3 points less per 100 possessions, surpassing 94% of the league's players; this season Kennard has played the most A long-lasting lineup (Reggie Kennard-George-Morris-Zubac) achieved a defensive efficiency of 98.0 in 203 rounds, surpassing 96% of the league's lineups. If you're still worried, the Grizzlies have better defensive resources inside the front line than the Clippers. I'm more optimistic about the team's defensive performance with Kennard on the court. Kennard’s greatest value? The Grizzlies' first/only key three-point shooter. What? Isn't it Bain? Unfortunately, due to reasons such as his wingspan, height, and bounce, Bane is unable to execute strong shots/pull-ups and other shooting options at critical moments. He prefers to use lateral steps, but this is too difficult to complete at critical moments. Kennard has the experience of hitting consecutive three-pointers at critical moments with the Clippers. He can hit three-pointers when the shooting space is not wide, which is something Bane cannot do; because of Morant's three-point level and He can't do this with his shooting posture; Dillon can take any shot, but Grizzlies fans may not want to see him take it. Ideally, whether it is a lineup of Morant-Bain-Kennard-Pheasant-Adams (Adams's super screen/front board is even more powerful for Kennard), or a lineup of Morant-Bay With the lineup of En-Kennard-Pheasant-Clarke (more mobile, Pheasant returns to squat 5, and the offensive space is full), the Grizzlies' space will be greatly improved. For offensive core Morant, when he holds the ball at the top of the arc, the space on both wings will be wider. The two top 13 players in the league, one on the left and one on the right, cannot afford to flank the opponent; for Jaren Jackson, his slow low post It will be easier to play in isolation, because the opponent will not let go of an outside perimeter to flank him. I'm very optimistic about Kennard. This is a good immediate addition at a negligible cost (even Kennard's contract for the next two years is easy to handle). #nbaTucaoConference##Memphis Grizzlies#",,,,"NBA Tucao Conference, Memphis Grizzlies",1,12,30,2/10/23 20:09,Weibo web version,['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/007mHWY4ly1haynjl6hk7j30u00u0ws1.jpg'],,

Acquiring Westbrook was one of the biggest mistakes in the history of the Lakers. For this reason, Pelinka removed important members of the team that won the championship in 2020. This season, the Lakers could have paid Pope ($14 million), Kuzma ($13 million) and Caruso ($9 million). The total salary of the three players is also much lower than Westbrook ($47 million) now. , the great god finally sent him away, a move that may save the Lakers' season. Yesterday, the Lakers traded Westbrook and a protected top-four pick in the 2027 first round to the Utah Jazz, bringing Watera, Beasley and Vanderbilt to Los Angeles. After returning to the Lakers after six years, Shuila's hair style has changed and he has matured. Putting aside defense, as the second scorer after James, he provides the outside firepower + organizational ability that the Lakers need. He doesn't need to change his style as dramatically as Westbrook, because he is already a high-quality shooter, and the young master's shooting is often unreal and unreasonable, and his output is still so high... This is what most fans have experienced in the past year and a half. Causes of cerebral hemorrhage. Defense aside, Beasley has been one of the NBA's best shooters for years, shooting 39% from catch-and-shoot three-point range since the 2018-19 season. During that stretch, only Basley has, according to SecondSpectrum. Dee Hilder is better than him and can be used as Munch's replacement. Vanderbilt can provide the Lakers with excellent defense. At 6-foot-8, he can protect the weak side and has a strong defensive presence. The Jazz have used him as a center for a long period of time this season, so the Lakers could choose to use him at the 4 position when James is not on the court. This season, his three-point shooting rate is 33.3%, most of which come from the right corner of the catch-and-shoot field. He seems to match up well with Lao James.

4.87E+15,Msltz1YW9,1930401644,North by Northwest_Caltrate,"Take action when it's time to take action After the trade deadline for the Xinjiang Guanghui Men's Basketball Team, the championship competition between the Eastern and Western NBA has become more intense, and the demand for players has become more precise. Tough defensive wings, stable shooters, guards who can control the pace and defend, and tough inside defenders have become popular. After all, with the blessing of superstars, the priority of the nerve knife is no longer so high. Likewise for the CBA, there are only a dozen or so games in the third stage, which are the last chances for the 5th to 10th place. With the winning margin almost the same, this arms race is particularly important. More than 20 days have passed since the end of the second stage. The Xinjiang team completed its assembly early, and Fall, Moultrie, and Clay also returned to the team to practice together. Currently, in addition to Fall's position that cannot be shaken, Moultrie, who has been unable to meet the playing standards for a long time, and Clay, who has been ghosting in several games, are not safe. After another crazy trading day, a group of players who may be bought out by teams have appeared in the NBA for CBA's reference. -Backcourt Chapter-1. The bargain-hunting Suns guards, the original Clippers duo Reggie and Wall, are likely to be bought out after being traded, and these two point guards and combo guards who average more than 10 points per game hope to join the Suns. Happy~ In addition to the cannon, the Suns also have Payne and Okogie at the first position. If the Suns really swallow up two powerful backup guards, then one of Okogie and Saben Lee may be waived. As Paul's younger brother, Okogie's contract expires this summer, while Saben's contract is only a two-way contract. Duane Washington Jr., whom he replaced, has entered the free agent market. These brothers are all 188+ in height. Guard, averaging 5-8 points per game. In addition, Forbes of the Timberwolves once played the role of a shooter under the old man, replacing Huang Ama, but he was also limited to the second position shooter and was too small. At most, he was more stable on the outside than Clemons, but he did not have the ability to break through with the ball. . Potential candidates: Duane Jr., Saben - Frontcourt - 1. Grab the wing swingman. The Magic are expected to buy out Terrence Ross. From the Raptors to the Magic, there is no doubt about Ross's physical fitness, but for the NBA , his characteristics of strong offense and weak defense still have a certain gap in the wing demand of championship teams, but his explosive scoring power should still be considered by the next club. In addition, the Wizards will buy out General Patton. Patton, who started his career with the Nuggets, also has a good basket. However, these two wings are unpredictable and neurotic. The Suns and Lakers still have unsatisfied needs for tough forwards. Justin Jackson, whom the Kaizi gave to the Thunder, really has no sense of presence. His shooting hot zone can only exceed 40% at 45 degrees on the left side, which really has no reference value. Potential candidate: General Patton 2. Use it to eliminate insider Ibaka. After being sent to the Pacers by the Bucks, he will be bought out if nothing unexpected happens. This 33-year-old veteran is different from 19 years ago. Now he has fallen out of the rotation, which is interesting. What's more, we have seen that the Liaoning media is also fighting for him. For CBA, 28 Ka, who specializes in frame protection and defense, also has three-point and mid-range shooting, and is still a strong presence. In addition, the Pacers waived Bitadze. This Georgian center has the solidity of a typical Eastern European inside line, but the threat on both offense and defense has dropped significantly after leaving the penalty area. Dedmon is from the Spurs. After the Heat returns him to the Spurs, he is expected to be waived. Averaged 5.7 points and 3.6 rebounds per game, he is more of a frame protector and secondary attacker, and does not pose much of a threat to the rim.

4.87E+15,MsjQi8pFP,6343075940,Lakers Chinese Nation,"Russell is gone, Russell is back, and the Lakers have found a path that can solve the current situation but not continue to overdraw the future. Acquiring Westbrook was one of the biggest mistakes in the history of the Lakers. For this reason, Pelinka removed important members of the team that won the championship in 2020. This season, the Lakers could have paid Pope ($14 million), Kuzma ($13 million) and Caruso ($9 million). The total salary of the three players is also much lower than Westbrook ($47 million) now. , the great god finally sent him away, a move that may save the Lakers' season. Yesterday, the Lakers traded Westbrook and a protected top-four pick in the 2027 first round to the Utah Jazz, bringing Watera, Beasley and Vanderbilt to Los Angeles. After returning to the Lakers after six years, Shuila's hair style has changed and he has matured. Putting aside defense, as the second scorer after James, he provides the outside firepower + organizational ability that the Lakers need. He doesn't need to change his style as dramatically as Westbrook, because he is already a high-quality shooter, and the young master's shooting is often unreal and unreasonable, and his output is still so high... This is what most fans have experienced in the past year and a half. Causes of cerebral hemorrhage. Defense aside, Beasley has been one of the NBA's best shooters for years, shooting 39% from catch-and-shoot three-point range since the 2018-19 season. During that stretch, only Basley has, according to SecondSpectrum. Dee Hilder is better than him and can be used as Munch's replacement. Vanderbilt can provide the Lakers with excellent defense. At 6-foot-8, he can protect the weak side and has a strong defensive presence. The Jazz have used him as a center for a long period of time this season, so the Lakers could choose to use him at the 4 position when James is not on the court. This season, his three-point shooting rate is 33.3%, most of which come from the right corner of the catch-and-shoot field. He seems to match up well with Lao James. This three-party deal changes the current situation of this season and protects the future. As long as Lao Zhan stabilizes the basics and performs like the top ten players in the league every night, the Lakers' competitiveness will still be online #湖人国#",,,,laker nation,11,98,200,2/10/23 7:16,,['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/006VgTOsly1hay118b0bjj30xw0mlkil.jpg'],,

The next opportunity for the team to strengthen is the buyout market. . 76ers reporter KYLENEUBECK lists some notable names on the buyout market: Three-point shooter/or defensive wing (3D): Potential targets: Danny Green, Will Barton On the bench, Green is a very reasonable option Rotation player, even as he returns from a knee injury suffered in last year's playoffs. Green was one of Philadelphia's only players willing to shoot for two years before his injury, and Barton is a younger, livelier option, though I'm not so sure he'll hit the market or whether Philadelphia would rank among suitors. Top of the list. Barton has been a pretty reliable shooter in recent seasons, including this year when he shot 38 percent from the field off the bench. But Patton is reportedly unhappy with his role in Washington, D.C. Backup 5 (C): Potential targets: Nerlens Noel, DeMarcus Cousins, Ken Boch? With James Wiseman headed to Detroit, Noel will inevitably have the opportunity to find a new home. Noel should work with Harden and/or Maxey on a near-basket lob attempt for an easy score. Noel could theoretically make up for his teammates' weaknesses in dribbling penetration. Cousins will take on a larger role offensively, giving them a true big man behind Embiid, though there's some speculation as to whether he'll be able to have a positive impact on games right now as Cousins struggles to make a difference after spending last season in Denver. No contract was signed. Currently, there aren't many good options in this location. If the Spurs decided to buy out early, Burch would be half a candidate, although I don't know why the Spurs would do that, and Burch hasn't been particularly good with the Raptors the past two seasons. Former Rockets: Potential Target: Patrick Beverley Does Beverley make sense as a buyout candidate for Philadelphia? Not special. He's been a reliable floor-spacing player for most of his career, but his shooting has struggled in recent years.

4.87E+15,MseU0ikgN,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[The Timberwolves gave the Lakers half a starter set] Transaction content: The Lakers acquired Russell from the Timberwolves, and Vanderbilt and Beasley from the Jazz; the Timberwolves acquired Conley, Alexander Walker, and the Jazz in 2025 and 26 from the Jazz. In the second round, the 24-year-old Wizards from the Lakers and the Grizzlies in the lower second round; the Jazz got Westbrook, Toscano Anderson, and Damian Jones from the Lakers, and the 27-year-old Lakers protected first round (1 -4th pick, if you can't get it, you will become the second round in 2027). Let's go back to the summer of 2022, look at Minnesota from afar, and imagine how this team, which lost 6 games against the Grizzlies, will start a new journey? You see, the guy who is walking towards you, who slaps his old club in the face with his strength, is arrogant and is getting ready to mix experience and passion to charge ahead of the young people. Look, the guy doesn't pick his position or rhythm, and his confidence is soaring. The guard who shoots three-pointers, the guy next door is so greedy that he is salivating; look, that angry-eyed King Kong, he has a strong body, long arms, can run and jump well, he can be a frontline man on the outside, and he can be an iron tower and a mountain of meat on the inside. A man of iron and steel is really a hero; look again, the young man who is pouting and moving in pick-and-rolls, at the age of 26, has taken the steps of a 62-year-old, but there is no shortage of throws, jumpers, and cakes with one hand. As a high-paying yamen escort hired by the Ming government, the wolves were even more in awe of him. Led by two talented leaders, the wolves will attack towards a higher goal. The core player who is good at hitting the basket will help them tear apart the defense, while the other top pick inside will get more alley-oop opportunities with the help of space. The inside and outside are harmonious, the protagonist and the puzzle complement each other, and a bright future is waving to the wolves. So, let’s take a look at the two leading wolves: So, are they the Los Angeles Timberwolves now? In June last year, could you have imagined that Westbrook + Tucker + 1 first round + 1 second round would eventually become half of the Timberwolves team? Beverley, Russell, Beasley, Vanderbilt, in addition to Hua Zi, Towns and Jayden - the team's nominal boss and two not for sale - these four people are the Timberwolves who have played the most playoff time. Rotate. It can be roughly believed that Hua Zi and Towns of the Timberwolves in the playoffs were replaced by Zhan Mei. In terms of rotation in the middle and late stages, the Timberwolves' Jaden, Prince, McLaughlin, Reed, and Nowell at the time were probably inferior to the Lakers' current roster of Mob, Gabe, Schroeder, Reeves, Walker, and Hachimura. The advantages are also limited. Without looking at the process, just looking at the results, it is indeed difficult for you to understand how the Lakers managed to change the situation. Looking at the value of the game and the contract value at that time, the two melons and one date in the Lakers' hands are completely incompatible with the Timberwolves' three starters + one rotation. But the market is so magical, and time can change many things. Clever third-party transfers, combined with the special needs of the respective team management, can turn some impossible operations into reality. There are three keys here: first, the Jazz need future salary space; second, Westbrook has an expiring contract value; third, Russell is a contract that is difficult to renew. These three keys increased the value of the chips in the Lakers' hands, lowered Russell's market price, and made it possible for the Lakers to acquire him. This is why, on last year's deadline and during the vacation, there were always people who emphasized not to rush to sell Westbrook. His contract value will be different at different times and with different destinations. Only by the deadline of the contract year, as an expiring contract that can clear out 47.1 million in space, can Westbrook be sold as a less negative or even positive asset. For the Jazz, Conley's partially guaranteed contract for next season is guaranteed at $14.3 million. His level has declined, he is old and has a high risk of injury, and is not in the Jazz's long-term plan. The Jazz will clear him out of this deal and gain a lot of salary space this summer. If you advance, you can introduce high-quality puzzles, if you retreat, you can eat garbage contracts and get the first round. In other words, Angie seems to be a good guy, and Wade seems to be playing Poseidon to deliver the Holy Cloth from thousands of miles away, assisting Saint Seiya James to defend Athena, but in fact they still get what they need. The space the Jazz cleared from this deal is likely to be worth more than a first-rounder in the future. Then you may ask, even if the Jazz need Westbrook to clear Conley's contract for next season, what about Vanderbilt and Billis? Did the Jazz only want a first-rounder from the Lakers, or did they protect the top four picks and give the Timberwolves two second-rounders? This is because Vanderbilt and Beasley are overestimated by many fans. This point has been explained in the previous trading market review. Vanderbilt is a special puzzle that is neither 3D nor center. His value in the market is between two second rounds and one first round, and he needs to be combined with other assets. , to get a first-round pick. Beasley's value is even lower. Apart from shooting, Beasley lacks other contributions. His value is lower than his two-year contract of 15.6 million + 16.5 million, and he is a marginal rotation in the playoff team. Of the assets the Jazz gave away, the only one that was truly valuable was Vanderbilt. Conley is only attractive to certain teams, and no one will pursue him with too valuable assets. Therefore, the Jazz actually used two second rounds and Van Der Biao to clear space, and took a first round by the way. So what happened to the Timberwolves? They sponsored half of the Lakers' starters through the Jazz transfer. Regarding the Timberwolves' point guard problem, it has always been like this: Since there are almost no additional assets to package, Russell cannot be replaced by a better point guard than Russell, so Russell cannot be used to strengthen him. The Timberwolves traded Russell for Conley not to upgrade the lineup. Conley's level this season is not higher than Russell's. They made this deal only for this reason - the contract extension negotiations with Russell did not go smoothly, and the Timberwolves did not have the confidence to retain him at a reasonable price. that's it? Let’s guess the reason for the thick black spot: If you were Connery and made a historic deal that was ridiculed by the crowd, would you be willing to do it? If they don't try to restore the reputation of Gobert's deal, the Timberwolves management will not have to hang out in the industry in the future. The Timberwolves brought in Conley, who is more stable in passing and controlling, which is equivalent to copying and pasting the Jazz's original starting position at position 1/5. This is of course helpful for activating Gobert. Conley has finished playing this year and still has one year left on his contract, which will allow the Timberwolves to temporarily put aside the issue of renewing the No. 1 position and buy them some time to digest the twin towers. Of course, it’s also possible to stop trying to digest the Twin Towers. After the team's future focus has completely shifted to Edwards, Towns is no longer an official in the Ming Dynasty, and there is no need to keep the helpers around him. With Russell gone, it is uncertain whether Towns will become a bargaining chip in the future to optimize the Timberwolves' No. 1 position and forward depth. After all, Conley is getting older and will need a successor sooner or later. With the Timberwolves' meager bargaining chips, they have to start with Towns if they want to solve the problem. I think it is possible to break up Towns' contract in the future and turn it into something like a certain second-line point guard + Bojan + O'Neal + draft picks. After the Timberwolves took that step that changed history, they couldn't stay where they were and wait for the world to change for them. The subsequent operations were all interconnected. You can think that Connery bought a mobile phone from a hawker and found that it couldn't be turned on, so he went to the hawker, and the hawker conveniently sold him a charger. The Lakers are the easiest party to understand this deal. There are three things they need to solve: first, a shooter to open up the space; second, a backcourt pick-and-roll player who can shoot and pass; third, a large forward to lead the defense. Use one transaction to solve all three things. Of course, 1 protected first-rounder, 1 second-rounder, plus Westbrook with scraps to fill the three major needs, obviously will not be perfect. Russell, Beasley, and Vanderbilt each have their own problems. The defense of the first two is poor. As a starter together, the defensive disadvantages will be superimposed, and Vanderbilt's space threat is very small, which means it brings urgent needs. While contributing, it will amplify the Lakers' disadvantages in other aspects. Even so, the overall benefits outweigh the disadvantages. The key depends on how Ham uses people. Russell + Beverley + Van Der Biao + James + Eyebrow, the Timberwolves' three starters + the Lakers' dual core. This mix is the simplest plan and has strong defensive ability. But compared to Towns' five-space ability and Huazi's shooting style, Zhan Mei provides less space, and the offensive compatibility remains to be considered. More combinations need to be discovered and tried by Ham. Pelinka has regained his qualifications as a human being, and this transaction should indeed be recorded as a classic case. The Lakers found overlapping interests from the Jazz and Timberwolves. These interests were very specific and not universal, which allowed the Lakers to make a deal that looked like robbery. But looking at it from the perspective of the Jazz and Timberwolves, it makes sense. All I can say is that no matter how difficult the situation is, you can always find a way. In the past five years, Westbrook has changed five teams, which seems to prove this point. I wish him the best and finally found relief.

In the afternoon, he slapped me hard: the Nets sent Durant in exchange for Bridges, Johnson and... Draft picks. Specific transaction plan: The Nets send Durant and TJ Warren, and receive Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Jae Crowder, four first-round picks and the 2028 first-round exchange from the Suns. Exchange rights. I had mixed feelings after seeing it. First of all, I was very happy. Within a few days of taking office, the new boss traded for the strongest player in the world - Kevin Durant. His peak tail is still dominant, and he teamed up with Paul, Booker and Ayton, the probability of winning this year has increased! The veteran's career is hopefully coming to a successful conclusion! But the unhappy mood never dissipated. The team sent away Bridges Bridges, who has always been called not for sale, and Cameron Johnson. These two are really one of my favorite players. Bridges (right 2 in Figure 5) is the most dedicated player in the world! He is called the Iron Man or the donkey of the production team by fans [face covering]. He has never missed a game from college to the NBA. He has to play the longest time every day and defend the strongest player on the opposite side. Last season, his total playing time and The running distance is the longest in the league! As a result, he entered the best defensive team in the 21-22 season and ranked second in the best defensive player list! In the first round of the playoffs last year in the Tianwangshan battle, he took a six-second break and led the team to kill the Pelicans! The Suns have suffered a wave of injuries this season, and Tieren Bridge has to take on more responsibilities, develop a ball-handling offense, and let fans see that he is more than a 3D player. It was his efforts that won him the Western Conference Player of the Week last week. Nominated. He is only 26 years old, but he is still the team's funnyman, with unlimited potential... Cameron Johnson (right 1 in Figure 5) is a forward shooter of the Suns. He is ""old"" and accurate and is called Lao Huang Zhong by fans. Enter The league continues to improve and has gradually grown into a bench firepower for the Suns, ranking third in the best sixth man list last season. This season, due to the team's starting No. 4 Jae Crowder (who refused to play), he was appointed to take over the team's starting No. 4 position. However, the sudden task made him unable to adapt. After playing 8 games, he was injured due to the injury in half a month. He was sidelined for a long time due to a torn plate injury and just returned about a month ago. After his return, he maintained his posture as a shooter and became an important firepower for the team! He and Bridges are called the Cambridge brothers (picture 9), and they are both the funny people in the team! The 32-year-old Crowder is a player signed by the team two years ago (Picture 5, left 1). He has a tough style of play and is the type that only fans of his own team like and hate when other teams hate him. He is decisive and experienced. Fearing confrontation, in the second game of the Western Conference Finals of the 20-21 season playoffs, it was his serve that assisted Ayton to complete the buzzer beater. In the finals, the Suns, who were weak inside, were helpless against the impact of ""Antetokounmpo"", but Crowder used his body to erect a barrier time and time again. This season, Crowder refused to play for the Suns due to contract issues, leaving only Craig (2nd from the left in Figure 5) among the team's ""four famous catchers""... Well now, I have two home teams, One is the Suns and the other is the Nets. I really can’t bear to leave Da Qiao and Huang Zhong [I’m about to cry].

You will find that it will be very simple to create open three-point opportunities by playing like this. Why does the Nuggets' insideout look so easy? O Web link Jokic's own low-post threat is certainly important, but there is a prerequisite here, receiving the ball in the low-post. If you can't even catch the ball, how can you talk about inside-outside connection. This offense of the 76ers combined Pistol with dynamic low-post tactics. The three-man team cooperated at a 45-degree angle. Tucker covered Harden who was advancing from the sideline, and then flared around Embiid's screen. This is the ""Dribble"" in Pistol tactics. ""Playstyle O web link, but Tucker's role here is not the flarecut we usually see to the top of the arc, but as a transition point to the weak side, with Melton near the paint area covering Embiid to the other side. One side is low, forming a dynamic low post. The difficulty of catching the ball is immediately reduced by N levels. Not only is it comfortable to catch the ball, but the position of the ball is also very close to the basket. The Lakers immediately shrink the double team and create a wide open three-point opportunity inside. Formed immediately. Some fans have previously said that Embiid's ability to handle the ball in the low post is not good and he is prone to mistakes. There are two reasons: 1.76 players do not have many tactics to release defensive pressure in the low post and are prone to interceptions. 2. The fans’ own expectations are too high. Taking Jokic as the standard, every center’s passing ability must be as good as Jokic’s. If not, it is said that it is not worth designing low-post tactics for Embiid, and Evaluate Embiid's passing ability as ""not good"". But in fact, the threshold for passing inside out is not that high. Embiid does not handle the wide range of passes on the weak side well, but if you want to say that others can't hit the ball from the same side, it is too underestimated for NBA players. I just posted a video at the beginning of the season. Embiid's insideout on the same side can definitely be easily controlled. Some teams will choose weak-side players to double-team, which is to target your weak-side passing ability. At this time, the weak-side players need to take the initiative to run over to the strong-side to support them. For example, setting up a perimeter screen for the weak-side shooter to come to the strong-side. Connected with Embiid, of course the specific design plan is Rivers' business.

To put it bluntly, no matter how capable Ronaldo is, he has not officially played a game for more than a month. So putting aside the competitive aspect, yesterday’s exhibition match was actually a perfect show. If you don’t compete for fame and fortune, it’s not a one-time winner. Let’s talk about it from another angle. In the past ten years, have you ever seen Messi and Ronaldo face each other? Have you ever had such a harmonious duel with a smile? Both of them are guests invited by Saudi Arabia. If they are given enough money, they can play whatever they want to make the boss and the audience happy. Although the media is lamenting the end of an era, seeing the two hugging each other and sharing photos of each other on social media, it seems that all the tension, joy and hatred in the past have been forgotten. Of course, we don’t know what is going on in our hearts. At least that's how it seems on the surface. I would say that after the last El Clasico in 2018, the significance of Melo's duel was in name only. Since then, both Cristiano Ronaldo's Juventus and Messi's Barcelona have fallen far away from the level of Europe's top teams. Naturally, such a strong game won't be that good to watch. They met and laughed away their grudges. We should also look away from the two of them. Which one of Messi and Ronaldo is stronger has been decided for a long time. Look at how happy Ronaldo was last night. Maybe people themselves have reconciled with themselves. Every Melo matchup in the past is engraved on our youth like annual rings. Now it’s time for us to look to the new generation. Just after this game ended, Haaland scored 22 goals in the Premier League to help Manchester City reverse Tottenham.

4.86E+15,MoH4A3oKD,6748483996,Qiu Mo Austin,"If you are an NBA fan who has been involved in the past two years, I think the Grizzlies are your best home team choice. Last year's record was second in the league, and the playoffs and championship were inseparable; this year's record was second in the league, and the core rotation was almost stronger than last season. At this time, it meets all the elements of a home team for new fans: 1) A talented star. Morant is considered the ""most representative Z-era star"" in the NBA. He has the only attention of his age on various social media (not domestic Douyin); the league's third point guard has both playing styles. A combo guard with offensive power and organizational skills; top-notch viewing ability, top ten ball is like drinking water; only 23 years old. 2) Good prospects for the championship. A championship team confirmed in the past two years and the next few years; all three core players have signed/immediately sign big contracts; the lineup is young and ready to compete (this is usually not both possible); the salary structure is healthy and reasonable (counterexamples: several A big city team with star players); cautious management (maybe a little conservative, but not stupid). 3) Extensive topicality and attention. Just look at what Warriors fans say every day. They are everywhere. If you break it down a little more, this team also has some characteristics: this season, it is the only one in the league that has a 30-0 lead in games leading by more than 10 points. The No. 1 tailwind team, not afraid of reversals, and not nervous when watching the ball; the team has experts in all aspects, breakthrough/passing (Morant), shooter (Bain), defense/old school (Dillon), blocking (JJJ), rebounds (Adams), the starting lineup is quite complete; the home team has a good atmosphere, everyone is about the same age and does everything together, and is the team that takes group photos with the team most often after winning games; the fans have a good atmosphere, unlike some teams The home court was quiet and even switched sides to cheer the opponent. Finally, I think the Grizzlies can embody the Olympic spirit: higher (first in rebounds, second in front rebound rate, the only team in the league with three inside rotations above 211), faster (third in number of rounds, Moran Special), stronger (2nd in record, 2nd in points differential). They may play very raw, very physical, and very rough, but if you never care about the so-called high-level data, never compete online, and just want to watch a game a few days a week to stimulate and relax your body and mind, Gray Bears will never let you down. #nbaTucaoConference#",,,,NBA Tucao Conference,0,7,13,1/17/23 11:04,Weibo web version,"['https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/007mHWY4ly1ha6gr2vz4dj318g0tlawe.jpg', 'https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/007mHWY4ly1ha6gr5do7vj31z416kdvm.jpg']",,

Cole has already stated the characteristics of his coaching at the very beginning. We like to attack in the low post. This is an offensive method that goes against the trend of the times. Not following the trend is what makes this champion A bright spot for the team. Moreover, the Golden State Warriors' low-post offense has a characteristic. I also mentioned last time that Kerr's thinking is not limited to using only players with strong low-post scoring ability or strong passing ability to play low-post offense. There are many mediocre players. They have all played the role of initiators of low-post attacks. This phenomenon has lasted through various periods from the Splash Brothers, Tsunami Brothers, five-star lineups to last season's rebirth. 2. Yongtu's low post attack is most commonly combined with ""Split"" and ""StaggerSplit"", but when Cole shared this tactic, he mentioned a phrase, ""Gaggleaction"". The word ""Gaggle"" comes from Popovich, the Spurs coach who Cole once played for. It generally refers to the cooperation of three people stacked together, and ""StaggerSplit"" is this kind of compound cover cooperation composed of three people. Here is an original quote that Popovich said: ""Now this side is going to do what we calla Gaggle, and [overthere] that's going to beat two-mangame."" From this original quote, we can see that Popovich likes to use the weak side's Gaggle coordination (Stagger). Contain the defense and create two-player basketball opportunities for the strong side. A classic example is the ""13Roll"" tactic that the Spurs have played for many years. But I feel that this fixed tactical routine cannot perfectly interpret the deep meaning of ""Gaggle"" because The essence of ""Gaggle"" is to use multiple players to come together to cause defensive chaos, so the deeper meaning of ""Gaggle"" can be truly reflected by reading the defense's irregular coordination. The Heat's ""Pistol55"" O web link is a good example. . 3. Regarding the interpretation of Cole's last sentence, I would like to add that why do you like to use Rooney who has no shooting ability to do a crossover (SplitScreen)? In addition to what Cole said, most big men like to be included in it, and more importantly The key point is that Rooney has no shooting ability, which further allows the opposite No. 5 player to relax and stay inside. In this way, when Rooney is covering the shooter, no one can switch defense, forming a 2-on-1 situation, creating a better situation for the shooter. Excellent shooting opportunity. So don't think of a center without shooting ability as useless. The shortcomings in your eyes are exactly an advantage in the eyes of Cole, who is not limited by his thinking.

4.86E+15,Mo5jXC4kc,2774033967,Huang Xiansen o,"Unknowingly, the Nets relied on a wave of winning streak to improve their record to the forefront of the Eastern Conference, and once threatened the Green Army's first position in the league. We all know that the Nets can achieve such results, in addition to the coach's strategizing, Simmons' recovery, Irving's increasingly mature basketball mind, and Durant's strong performance on both offense and defense. However, the Nets' overuse of Durant still caused great disadvantages, and Durant suffered another injury attack. This injury truce will require almost a month of rest, which puts pressure on the Nets' record. You know, so far this season, Durant has averaged 29.7 points, 6.7 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.5 blocks per game, with a shooting percentage of 55.9%. This is the performance of the league's top super giant. Durant is still the one who does nothing. The ""god of death"" who can't. While Durant is still in his prime, the Nets have to seize the opportunity to strengthen and rush to the championship. After all, such an opportunity is very rare; the Nets did not disappoint Durant. In the offseason, they still introduced O'Neal, Warren, and O'Neal. The four strikers are Morris and Yuta Watanabe. At the same time, famous reporter Woj broke the news that the Nets will also strengthen the frontcourt before the trade deadline. Can you see the determination of the Nets management to win the championship? There is no Buddhist style of the Lakers, and there is no hesitation of the Warriors. It gives people the impression of being decisive. When a person is hesitant and hesitant to do things, it is difficult to achieve great things. Success will only favor those who are strong and unwavering. So, how should the Nets operate? Isn’t this? Basketball reporter Piercy of the US media ""NBA Analysis Network"" broke the news that the Nets are very interested in Hawks forward Collins and have made a formal offer. The specific transaction chips are: Harris, O'Neal, and the 2028 first-round draft pick. Rights swap rights. In other words, this is a potential ""3-for-1"" transaction plan, and there is no third party participation. An anonymous executive also revealed that the Nets have a chance to acquire Collins through a trade. Looking at the trading chips offered by the Nets, they are already very sincere and attractive, and it is really hard to refuse. Harris is a three-point marksman. If used properly, he will have the same effect as Clay, making the team's outside shooting full of deterrence; and what about O'Neal? He is the best 3D wing in the league and is responsible for the Nets' second record in the Eastern Conference this season. O'Neal not only has accurate three-pointers, but also has good defense and passing. His functional attributes are comparable to those of the Warriors last season. Striker Porter. Once the Hawks can acquire these two warriors, the three-point threat from the outside will increase, which is very conducive to Trae Young and Murray's ball-handling offense, and the two backcourts will be able to receive high-quality space blessings. But what is the attitude of the Eagles? The management hopes to get the rewards of Mitchell and Gobert in this transaction, and even targets Simmons, which is tantamount to taking advantage of the situation. After all, Collins is not the key player in the Hawks, but more like a space-oriented fourth position. As for the Nets? Although Harris has accurate three-pointers, the team already has shooters like Curry and Mills, and their functional needs have overlapped, which is why he was abandoned. O'Neal's tactical status is obviously more important. Such a transaction is like a big gamble for the Nets; although Collins has a three-point shooting ability, his passing and shooting abilities are obviously not as good as O'Neal. But in order to reduce the pressure on Durant, you can still try Collins as a forward. After all, his playing style is still very tough, and he is a man who has dunked on Embiid. When the starting lineup becomes Irving, Durant, Simmons, Collins, and Claxton, the Nets' offense and defense are also very good, and their rebound protection ability will even be stronger. After all, the average height has been increased, and only Irving is the same. Just a defender.",,,,,0,0,0,1/13/23 10:57,Weibo web version,,,

Please look at the current time and you will realize how smooth this game is: the first half ended in less than an hour, and the assist and turnover data of both sides Exactly the same, 15 assists and 4 turnovers. Although they are all remnants, the Nets started their first game without Durant, and the Celtics were missing Jaylen Brown and Horford, the two third overall picks, but this half of the game still fully explained why they are currently the best team in the world. The top two players in the league, for example, when Tatum was under heavy attention from the Nets, Derrick White stepped up and made three-pointers that had been inaccurate recently, such as Brogdon, Grant Williams and even Cornet continued to To attack the Nets' relatively weak interior defense. Similarly, with the Nets, Irving still maintains his one-on-one ability against a tough opponent, but the ones who can maintain his scoring are Durant's stand-in TJ Warren, Joe Harris and Seth Curry. These two shooters who are among the top five shooters in NBA history, four of the Nets scored in double figures in the half. Ben Simmons played a half game with mixed reviews. His defensive size, fast break ball play, and handoff quality all played a key role. He sent out 10 assists in the half, but his personal offensive threat was really limited. , and the unnecessary foul sent him to the bench early. From a visual point of view, the Nets have paid great attention to the protection of rebounds, but at halftime, the rebounds of both sides were 27 to 15, and the offensive rebounds were 9 to 2. This is the significance of the Celtics putting Rowe in today's game. Although Lowe didn't score much in rebounding, he attracted a lot of boxout troops, which essentially gave him a huge advantage in rebounding. Both sides played 9 players in the half, but the Nets' Sumner only transitioned for 2 minutes. The Celtics may also further compress Hauser's time in the second half. Short rotation is undoubtedly a sign that the teams value each other. , the game will become more and more tense as it goes on, and the key to victory or defeat in the second half may still lie in the hands of Tatum. If he can continue his performance in the last two minutes of the first half, the Celtics can escape. PS: Although the game was fierce, the atmosphere was still quite friendly.

4.86E+15,MnHjQDjaO,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Chat about the possibility of James leaving the team] A small chat. It is said that several teams in the market are preparing for James' possible departure in the summer. Judging from the current situation, unless something changes again, James is still very likely to stay on the team, because the Lakers have salary space to strengthen this summer and there are many available stars on the market. At the same time, James still has a contract. Even if he considers leaving the team, there is no need to leave as soon as the market opens. He can still observe the quality of the Lakers' operations during the vacation. So, now is not the time to discuss this topic seriously. Even if there is only a small probability, it is still worth planning in advance to have the opportunity to pursue a star of this level from the market. Since James is not a free agent and will have to be acquired in a trade anyway, suitors do not need to clear space in advance for the summer. The best preparation you can do is don't mess around and wait for the news. Which teams would be interested in James? The first thing that comes to mind is naturally the two old clubs, the Cavaliers and the Heat. The Cavaliers' chances are zero. If we go back to this time last year, the Cavaliers may be the most promising company among James' potential suitors. Regardless of the relationship between the two parties, the knight's needs, or the chips in hand, it is enough to complete a transaction that satisfies all three parties. However, Cavaliers stud Mitchell has basically exhausted all his movable assets, and it is very difficult to launch another big transaction. You may ask, James is so old, does it really take a lot of chips to pursue him? Not ""very much,"" but not very little either. At the beginning of the season, James was in poor competitive form, missed many finishing opportunities, and made explosive mistakes. It really made people doubt whether he had completely ended his peak and entered a real retirement stage. Since then, James' condition has continued to improve. Since December, all aspects have been the same as or even slightly better than the past two years. Except for the three-point sight that has not yet completely corrected, James has not declined significantly. His amazing anti-aging ability cannot be understood by ordinary people. His performance so far this season will give suitors hope that he will remain competitive in the next two years. For some teams that are eager to win now, this time is enough. Let’s see what the Cavaliers have: there are still no draft picks to give away this summer; apart from Mitchell, Garland, Mobley, and Allen, there are no high-value young players; between Mitchell, Garland, and Allen In addition, there are no large tens of millions of contracts that can be used for balancing; although there are a lot of expiring contracts, they are far from enough to clear the space for James. Pelinka is not interested in signing and trading for Love or LeVert. To replace James, the Cavaliers must move one of Mitchell, Garland, and Mobley. This is not worth the gain. For the Cavaliers, who have already paid for draft picks for many years to come, it is obviously better to build a stable team in the long term than to age quickly. Therefore, the Cavaliers are not a potential buyer. But the Heat are a potential next buyer. The Heat's situation is delicate. Their record is struggling, but they have not lost hope. They have talent reserves, but their level is average. Neither the near future nor the long term is particularly bright, nor is it particularly gloomy. The Heat can strengthen and insist on winning now, but the question is how much hope they have to save this season. Among the team's shooters, no one except Hiero can shoot more than 35% of the three-point shooting percentage. If these people don't make corrections, even if they strengthen, the season will still be hopeless. But the Heat will not rebuild on the spot. In the 20-21 season, the Heat, which just reached the Finals, also experienced a year of downturn, which is quite similar to the current situation. After that, they survived and reached the conference finals again. Stuck in a dilemma, when news of James appears on the market, the Heat should be excited. Let's not talk about whether they want to pursue James or not. Just the fact that ""James is possible"" has guiding significance for the Heat's current work-there is a step down. Before this season's trade deadline, the Heat don't have to worry about it. There is a big fish waiting to be caught, and the Heat can spend the vacation with peace of mind. Then it's time to make directional decisions. If Butler doesn't explode and accepts to play with James, then it would be logical for the Heat to pursue James with Herro's contract as the main body. The key here is, compared with Butler's contract until 2026, is it more tempting to regard Herro as one of the core members of the future team? I think not. Because Herro's ceiling is likely not as good as Butler's in the next three years. At the same time, Hiero's contract has a certain transaction value, which will allow the Heat to pursue James without overdrafting too many draft picks. Therefore, this may be the best way for the Heat to balance the present and the future: without completely sacrificing the future, seize the final peak of Butler and James and work hard for another 2 to 3 years. Of course, there is still a lot of repair work that needs to be done. The increase in the ceiling cannot cover up the chaos in the middle and later stages of the Heat's rotation. If a large number of undrafted players in sluggish form cannot support the depth of the bench, for Butler and James, whose attendance is not good, the troubles of their respective teams this season will have to reappear. Or put it this way - if the Heat's mid-to-late rotation is rotten, why doesn't James stay with the Lakers? In the past four years, half of the time, everyone in the Heat was happy, and half of the time, everyone was depressed. Which version they will approach in the future is crucial. In addition to the old club, several big city teams can also be discussed. Will the Knicks be the dark horses? The Knicks have enough leverage to pursue James and enough motivation to do so. Their question is whose contract should be used as the subject of exchange. As the final result of ""riding a donkey to find a horse"", is turning Randall into James an upgrade? It's hard to say whether James is more likely to age, or whether Schrödinger's Randall is more likely to maintain his form this season rather than last season. The point is that Randall's battery life advantage will smooth out the gap in absolute strength between him and James. This is something that needs to be weighed. Using Barrett's contract as the mainstay will give the Knicks a striker combination that leads the league in strength. But it also leaves the Knicks with two players on the front line who don't take over their strengths. Of course, this is not a big problem. Randall must make changes. Another way is the classic Fournier + Rose - this requires executing Rose's contract and increasing the total salary. For New York, money is not a big issue - and it also needs to be supported. The Knicks have enough draft picks to support this plan. James and Durant play in the same city, which is more interesting than Giancarlo being in Los Angeles. Now that Jandu can be in one city, why not go further? Is Boss Cai interested in holding Jandu at the same time? Using Simmons as the main player is one way. If the Lakers are not interested in Simmons, they can only sign and exchange Irving. Compared to the combination of Irving and thick eyebrows, what I want to see more is of course the story of ""ex, current and me"". Now that the mind is open, let’s look at a few more interesting combinations. Would James be interested in ""playing in Michael Jordan's city?"" The Bulls are at a crossroads of rebuilding or persisting. The reason why they cannot persist is that the current lineup does not have enough ceiling. So, if DeRozan and Ball, who can't play, are sent to Los Angeles in exchange for James, will the ceiling be raised? Here comes the problem. Like the comparison with Randall, the unavoidable topic is battery life. DeRozan can protect the Bulls' lower limit by being more diligent. Without this lower limit, James' stronger upper limit will be impossible to talk about. However, this realizes LaVine's dream of playing with James and can also solve James fans' longing for Caruso. More importantly, this allowed James to enter Jordan's territory and challenge him at the position closest to God. Will James go to another team in Los Angeles? The exchange of James and Leonard has the opportunity to ignite public opinion: If Leonard finds his second spring in the Lakers, forms the most abnormal forward defense in the league with his thick eyebrows and can attack alone, and then wins a championship trophy, then in the future For many years, we will be immersed in the ocean of public opinion that ""any superstar can team up with thick eyebrows""; and if James wins the Clippers championship, Leonard will be expelled from the superstar status. It's exciting just thinking about it. How about James coming to Golden State? We will lose Poole, Wiseman and Kuminga, but we can realize the dream of playing next to LeBron and realize the dream of James fans to have Thompson. This is not the point. Point is, Durant fans will tremble. Is it possible for East and West to play together? The 76ers can offer Maxi + Harris conditions. Harris only has one year left on his contract at this time, which means his combat effectiveness is not bad and his negative level has been reduced a lot. The rest depends on how the Lakers view Maxi. Another way is to sign and trade Harden, but this will fall into a paradox. XX: Brother Deng, I’m sorry, we can only give you a starting salary of 33 million yuan at most. As long as you have a salary cut once, the market will think you are worth this. We've checked out the market, and no one is going to offer you a higher salary. Harden: It doesn’t matter, I will leave the team. XX: Brother Deng, my friend for many years, please do me a favor before leaving. LeBron said that Maxi staying on the team was a necessary condition for him to come to Philadelphia. Therefore, we want to use your contract as the main body to sign a replacement for LeBron, who also plans to leave the team. Harden: Okay, I also want to play with Big Eyebrow. Harden: (calling Nongmei) Hello, Amei? I am Denzi. XX said he wanted to trade me for LeBron, so we could play together. Thick eyebrows: (looking at LeBron beside him) Are you going to Philadelphia? LeBron (with thick eyebrows, in Pelinka's office): (asking Pelinka opposite) Can we create space to sign Harden naked? Pelinka: Work hard, I guess it won’t be much different. LeBron: (eyebrows thick) Give Pelinka the phone. (To Pelinka) Tell Harden, don’t bother with signing and swapping, just pack your bags and come to Los Angeles tomorrow. My business in Los Angeles will take him with me. (Yan Bi turned around and walked towards the door, with a sly smile on his lips. He didn't look back, just said) ""Oh, by the way.

The 20-year-old rookie scored 14+3, Nunn was more useful, and the new anti-aircraft gun showed off. On January 10, Beijing time, the Lakers lost to the Nuggets 109 to 122 in an away game. Westbrook had 25 points, 7 rebounds and 7 assists, and Thomas Bryant had 17 points and 10 rebounds. Rookie Christie, who entered the starting lineup, scored 14 points and 3 rebounds, and Swider had 6 points and 5 rebounds. Nunn scored 15 points and 3 steals. The Lakers are short of major generals in this battle. James, Davis, Lonnie Walker, Reeves and Troy Brown are all absent, and their combat effectiveness is seriously damaged. The loss to the Nuggets, who had a strong team, was expected. However, the Lakers still showed bright spots in this situation. Rookie Christie entered the starting lineup for the first time and played an efficient performance. He made 6 of 8 shots, 2 of 3 three-pointers, and scored 14 points, 3 rebounds and 1 assist. Christie has the potential to become a 3D player. He played 23 games for the Lakers this season, averaging 3.4 points and 2.2 rebounds per game and shooting 43.9% from three-point range. Christie, who is 1.98 meters tall, still has great potential to be tapped. He is not yet 20 years old. It can be said that the Lakers made a small profit by selecting him. In this game, Christie's scoring set a new high in his NBA career. Another rookie Swider also made contributions in this battle. He scored 6 points, 5 rebounds and 3 assists. Swider made 2 of 5 three-pointers. Swider is a tall three-point shooter who is good at shooting three-pointers from fixed spots. With Swider's presence, it is logical for the Lakers to waive Matt Ryan. Swider performed well in last year's summer league, but performed poorly in the preseason and was subsequently injured and missed for a long time. He did not return until January 7. Nunn performed well on the bench, scoring 15 points, 1 rebound, 1 assist and 3 steals. Beverley retired due to injury in the first half, and Nunn took Beverley's place. Nunn's condition has recovered recently. He can provide more contributions on the offensive end than Beverley, while Hebei's defensive performance is average this season. In this game, Westbrook was in a sluggish first half, making 1 of 9 shots and only scoring 4 points on free throws. However, he caught up in the second half, shooting 8 of 12 shots and scoring 21 points in the second half. Thomas Bryant performed regularly and scored a double-double with 17 points and 10 rebounds. Schroeder's touch declined. He made 3 of 13 shots in this game and scored 14 points, 3 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals. For the Nuggets, Jokic had a triple-double with 14 points, 11 rebounds and 16 assists, and Murray had 34 points, 7 rebounds and 4 assists. Pope scored 16 points, 3 rebounds and 3 assists, which hurt his old club, the Lakers. The Nuggets had a strong team and took the lead from the first quarter. They firmly held the initiative throughout the game and led by up to 20 points. The Lakers' five-game winning streak was ended, and the team suffered too many injuries. Fortunately, James only suffered from ankle soreness and is expected to return in the next game.",,,,,0,0,0,1/10/23 19:07,NBA Super Talk,['https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/006TVSORly1h9yrgnxox8j30l40dy41n.jpg'],,
4.86E+15,MnEGb8Tpe,7296927424,Splashing Water_Warrior Nation,"Kerr talks about Baldwin correcting mistakes when he knows them: It's okay to make mistakes, recognize them, and you'll learn from them--Defend Wagner, correct mistakes when you know them--Win the trust of the team, the future is bright--Defense is the problem, veterans are pouring money into it Give it to you--playing the 5th position? Share the on-court responsibilities of Dream Chaser and Looney - grow into a player with both offense and defense, and become the Warriors' key 1. At the beginning of the second quarter against the Magic, rookie Baldwin Jr. defended Wagner at the three-point line. In an instant, Wagner Baldwin broke through the defense, dribbled the ball twice with his right hand, and then easily picked the basket and scored two points, giving the Magic a 32-31 lead. Less than a minute later, Cole called a timeout, looked at Baldwin and said, ""Patrick, do you know what you did wrong?"" ""Yes, Wagner broke through me on the right,"" Baldwin replied. No hint, no hesitation. Baldwin knows his mistake, and Kerr believes the youngster can correct it immediately. In the 15 minutes since he came on as a substitute, this mistake never happened again. ""It's perfect,"" Kerr said of Baldwin's mistake that day in an interview after the team's practice today. ""It's okay to make mistakes, and as long as you recognize them, you learn from them. Now you have to do this... ...No matter how many players there are in the league, you have to get to know everyone. That's a big part of being a rookie. When you come into this league, you don't know what the players are going to do, and it's like a memory card. 2. ""He's learning and I think he's going to have a very bright future -- skilled, very smart, very aware and very hard-working."" Baldwin has allowed him to win in nine of his last 13 games The team has more and more trust, and he has participated in the team's 3 consecutive games. ""You know, it was just a mistake, but don't make the same mistake twice in the league,"" Baldwin said. ""I learned that lesson from Wagner two nights ago. That was a big focus in practice today."" 3. Since December 13, Baldwin has shot 47.2% from beyond the arc, 17 of 36. As a long-range shooter, shooting is not a problem, defense will be the top priority next, and he knows this. His eyes and ears are often locked on Dreamcatcher, Thompson, Iguodala and Looney. Baldwin said: ""We have a lot of veterans in our locker room, and they also like their identity and like to share their experiences and information. Any time I have a question to ask Dream Chaser or Iguodala, they will listen and then give their own Experience teaches you without reservation."" 4. Cole viewed Baldwin as a power forward, but the rookie's shooting ability gave Cole the flexibility to play him as a small forward. In Basketball-Reference's positional evaluation, Baldwin played 70% of his 13 NBA games at power forward, 21% at small forward, 3% at shooting guard, and the final 7% at center. Kuminga, Wiseman and JaMcCaw Green are out tomorrow, and Kerr also expressed concerns about Looney and Green's playing time today. Looney has played in 151 consecutive regular season games, and his 23.3 minutes per game is a career high. Green played in 36 of the Warriors' 40 games, and the two assumed the main tasks in the Warriors' frontcourt. They'll also have a heavy load tomorrow against the Suns, and could Baldwin be a solution? Baldwin's official height is 6 feet 9 (2.05 meters) and his weight is 220 pounds. But PBJ said he is actually taller and heavier -- 6-foot-10, 230-235 pounds -- and he seemed willing to accept new challenges: ""I've never played the five position in my life. So if the team needs it, I am willing to accept the challenge."" 5. Bay Area reporter Dalton Johnson said of Baldwin that in less than two months, Baldwin will be 20 years old. He speaks calmly and firmly, like an experienced professional player. Fans are also looking forward to seeing him perform more as a three-point weapon. If Baldwin can play multiple positions on offense, he will also perform extremely well on the defensive end. Sooner or later, Baldwin will help the Warriors solve many problems.

NBA reporter Marc Stein disclosed in his latest report that the reason why the Lakers did not trade Bojan and refused to trade Bojan was because they felt that it was not worth using the first-round pick plus Beverley and Nunn in exchange for the veteran: "" There is currently no sign that the Lakers' minds will change. Last offseason, they thought they would package their two first-round picks in 2027 and 2029 in exchange for the Pacers' Myles Turner and Buddy Hill.

4.86E+15,Mnoiq4mTi,6046996812,Jing Yimo's Lost Island,"[Without the protagonist, no matter how good the show is, the Clippers have lost five games in a row and the Lakers have won five games in a row. The two teams are still 1.5 games away. The Clippers are considered to be a team with excellent depth and strong puzzles, while the Lakers are considered to have nothing except dual-core. The attendance gap between the two main players is not outrageous - Zhan Mei played a total of 56 games, and Kajiao played a total of 56 games. 47 games - but the record cannot widen the gap. Since there is no end in sight for Capricorn's rotation, and the thick eyebrows will come back sooner or later, it will be interesting if the Los Angeles duo are ranked in different positions in the second half of the season. The Clippers' problems are actually commonplace. From the beginning of the season to now, there has been no substantial change. The core point is that the main attack level is not enough. Kazi's legs were weak after his comeback, and his offensive ability was sharply reduced. He also had a truce every three days, and there was no continuity at all. He is the Clippers' only important tool that can ""destroy the city"". Without a leader, the difficulty of the other players' respective games will increase. George's overall level has not declined much, but when it comes to offense, he is pushed to the position of the first main attacker and cannot lead a top offense. Even so, when George can play, it is still a period when the Clippers' offense is relatively visible, and it can be regarded as a fig leaf. When he is on the court, the Clippers' offensive efficiency is 113.6, but when he is not on the court, the Clippers' offensive efficiency is only 103.9. . Reggie's level is no longer the same as it was two years ago, and Wall has not fulfilled enough expectations. If a team's point guard can't attack well, it's not easy to think about the offense well. Morris and Powell are unique secondary attackers. They can be the icing on the cake, but they can't support the overall situation. Regarding the issue of the Clippers, there are two factions based on different positions: one is the anti-Lu faction, which believes that Lue did not use this good hand of cards clearly; the other is the anti-Clippers group, who believes that the Kaiser takes frequent breaks and disrupts the rotation. As a result, the team's morale is unstable and the puzzle pieces are not working hard. Both factions have some truth, but the solutions proposed by either faction are not enough to completely reverse the situation of the Clippers. Because even if Brother Kazi ends his rotation and guarantees attendance, if his leg strength cannot be restored and he only contributes to defense and squatting with the ball, the Clippers will not be able to compete for the championship. Replacing Lu with another coach will not solve the limitations of the personnel at hand. After all, many employer criticisms are simply blocking both ends and creating an endless loop: Morris is a garbage defender, why use him? Covington's defense is good, but Covington's offense is not that bad; Morris and Covington are not good, and Kaojiao doesn't play well, so of course he can only put a bunch of defenders up there. Lu will make many detailed mistakes, but some employment issues reflect that the Clippers do not have the optimal solution. For example, the limitations of the Clippers' defense were the biggest concern about their playoff prospects before the start of the season. Zubac is good at protecting the basket, but he suffers greatly when faced with military training and five-way play. The small lineup without Zubac has continuously exposed its shortcomings of small size and poor rim protection in the past two years, which does not work well in all situations. This contradiction in trade-offs not only increases the difficulty of recruiting Lu, but also requires the Clippers to be both offensive and defensive. When the big lineup is under military training, the small lineup is blocked in the paint, and the defense is ineffective, you have to rely on the full space of the small lineup to win the battle. In the 2021 playoffs, this is the plot of several of their games against the Mavericks and Jazz. Therefore, it is not fatal that the defense has limitations. What is really fatal is that the offense fails when the limitations are not resolved. The Clippers' offensive efficiency of 110.1 this season is completely unacceptable, but this number would still rank eighth in the league in the 2017-18 season. The Clippers' fixed-point shooting is just okay, and their three-point shooting is in the upper half of the league. However, compared to their nearly full-rotation fatal accuracy in the 20-21 season, this overall three-point shooting is just passable and cannot make up for the weaknesses in other areas. ——Only good space is not enough these days. The resources of top offensive teams are too ""volume"". The Nuggets and Mavericks have top-notch ball-carrying cores, five outside environments, and even high-quality finishes; the Celtics have extreme space, double main attack points on the front line with excellent attendance, and multiple backcourts that can handle the ball; the Nets have double A hard-hit attacker, a super-efficient interior end point, a forward who can handle the ball, and a deadly shooter; the Kings and Jazz have a large number of above-par ball handlers, excellent shooters, and interior support points; the Pelicans have many excellent attackers, absolutely Strength advantage and youthful vitality. Everyone's offensive configuration is getting more and more outrageous. Looking at the Clippers, they lack a top attacker, no inside support points, and no qualified point guards. They only have decent space and multiple decent secondary attackers. Naturally, there is no advantage. Among the strong offensive teams, only the Knicks' configuration looks ""people-friendly"" and their play style is simple. However, the Knicks can guarantee the quality of shooting and grabbing of the simple play style, and their front-board ability is incomprehensible. Most of the Clippers players are half-baked in forced development, and their athletic ability does not support violent rushes, nor can they play simple games. Look at it this way, the Clippers used the league's highest salary to build a lineup that can't do anything? It's not that Ballmer is the biggest enemy and hired a bunch of half-hearted players, but that in the Clippers' modern team-building structure, two roles are missing: one is a small-ball center. This is the key to playing five small players and doing a good job in defense; the other is the core of holding the ball. Puzzles that can drive deflection, less support, and less energy. The Clippers have never had either of these roles, and the closest thing to this role is Leonard. On the defensive end, together with Batum and George, he can nearly complete the work of a small-ball center. After returning from injury, this is also the end where he performed better. In the 2021 playoffs, as the Clippers' small-ball lineup gradually matures in defense, Kaziger's super defensive ability is undoubtedly revealed. This should be enough to convince the Clippers to stick to the small-ball decisive game. On the offensive end, Brother Kazi is not only the team's most impactful player who can change the formation, but also the team's best attacker. In the case where multiple puzzles have certain independent offensive capabilities, in most situations, it is barely enough for him to play the role of driving core. Therefore, regarding the various changes in the future of the Clippers, if there is no plot such as ""Brother Kazi recovers his leg strength and regains his former self"", everything else is meaningless. From this perspective, the problem is indeed Brother Kazi’s own. In the final analysis, the Clippers' drama is to complement him. Only when he takes the lead can other Jigsaw puzzles be able to contribute in suitable roles. Of course, you can also say that the Clippers failed to fully consider Leonard's health risks when configuring their lineup. After spending so much money, they should have the depth to handle Leonard's rotation. What's more, the Clippers did do it in the first two years or even the first three years of the initial team formation. Things have changed: In order to increase the upper limit, the Clippers have long cleared out Lu Wei and Harrell, who guarantee the lower limit of the rest team. The current lineup does not have this level of pick-and-roll starters; Reggie's highlight only lasted for one season, and the next two years as the starting point guard for a playoff team are too shabby. Wall's performance was not good at all. The two people's failure to meet expectations is the key to the Clippers' failure to guarantee the team's lower limit during the rotation; last season, the Clippers' offense was also poor, and their ability to stay in the top eight in the Western Conference was also due to defense. The Clippers' overall defense is still good this season, but there have been recent ups and downs, but Batum's attendance must also be considered. When all personnel are present, this end is still a relatively normal end. Cutting the camera to the Lakers can give you a deeper understanding of the Clippers' problems: the Lakers' space is much worse than the Clippers'; the Lakers' half-baked ball-holding resources are overflowing, and compared to the Clippers, the ability of their secondary attackers is not necessarily much better. However, the Lakers have two advantages that the Clippers cannot match: the Lakers have a more reliable offensive drive. During the absence of thick eyebrows, James was in great condition. When James was absent, the breakthrough and passing abilities of the Lakers' ball-handlers were also stronger than those of the Clippers' players at the same position, and this is the more critical ability to drive the team; the Lakers' No. 5 offense It goes without saying that he has super strong eyebrows. During the absence of thick eyebrows, Mob delivered top-notch mid-range shots and finishes. His efficiency is invincible, no less than that of thick eyebrows. The ball-holding core and the fifth position are the two most critical protagonist positions on the offensive end. And without the protagonist, no matter how good the play is, nothing can happen.

However, this situation may indeed happen to a team with seven consecutive wins. Although some people think that the seven-game winning streak is a bonus for the schedule, after all, there has been a winning streak that has not happened in ten years. In the past ten years, it does not necessarily mean that the team has not experienced seven consecutive games that ""should win"", and the team is now missing A wave of winning streak won by the resilience of Major General Bing cannot be explained by a simple ""schedule benefit"", so this is a possible night after seven consecutive victories, not to mention that the opponent has just received a sap from the Thunder. , the Celtics have a great record and a well-organized staff. Red list: Hardy: In his rookie season, he has scored double figures in a single quarter for the second time in the regular season. His 15 points also tied his personal NBA regular season scoring record. He looks like he will be a good talented scorer. . Powell: At halftime, I thought Kidd would start him in the third quarter, but it didn't happen. However, when the intensity of the game dropped slightly in the fourth quarter, his hard work earned him good data. Neither red nor black: Doncic: Only 3 of 9 in the first quarter, 0 of 2 three-pointers, 5 of 7 free throws, 11 points and 3 rebounds. The Celtics' defensive switching strategy is not necessarily very clever, but it is obviously effective against Doncic, who is not in the best physical and mental condition. In fact, contrary to some opinions, I rarely mention ""Doncic"". ""Too tired"", because at such an age, it is strange to often mention ""too tired"" even if the load is heavy, and it seems that Doncic is prone to resting after he has had enough rest. On the contrary, he can inspire better under continuous combat. of myself. This is a shot that will definitely come up in the marathon, but we all know Doncic will adjust back. Wood: It is not easy to deal with the Celtics' inside line. Although they work hard, it is really difficult to finish in the first shot. It is difficult to defeat the opponent only by relying on the piecemeal attack of the second attack. Dinwiddie: When the shooters are misfiring, Dinwiddie's pressure is no less than that of Doncic. When leading the second lineup, he often has to partner with different teammates and their touch is unpredictable, which is not easy in itself. , not to mention that his own recent finishing touch is not the best. Black list: THJ: It is self-evident how important his three-pointer is to the operation of the team's current system, but THJ failed to hit the ball accurately and the game became difficult to play. Bullock: Looking at his willingness to take shots, you would think that he made 0 of 6 shots or 0 of 8 shots. But in fact, he only took one shot in this game. Some games require the individual shooter of this team. Although he took 10 three-pointers per game, Bullock obviously cannot play with such intensity at the moment. Bertans: As an important outside shooter for the second team, his three-point shooting percentage in the last five games is 1 for 12. This is not the adjustment ability that the league's top outside shooters should have. Today, three failed outside shots in the transition period directly wiped out his playing time in the second half. McKinley Wright IV: The arrangement of him and Doncic appearing on one side at the same time is simply unbelievable. After all, everyone knows that his three-pointers are unreliable and he does not trust his own three-pointers. After getting the ball, More willing to break through operations. It's also good to be proactive on defense, but it's not the first time that he made three free throws because of his aggressive attack.",,,,,0,2,4,1/6/23 17:58,mavschina super talk,['https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/87dd6bf7ly1h9u2zwysptj21a40ttjyc.jpg'],,

What is the connection between the ""World Cup Golden Ball Award"" and the ""Golden Ball Award""? The World Cup Golden Ball was awarded for the first time in the 1982 World Cup. The author searched for the Golden Globe winner of each World Cup and the corresponding relationship with the current Golden Globe Award or (year-World Cup Golden Globe Award-Golden Globe Award): 1982-Paul Rossi-Paul Rossi; 1986- Diego Maradona - Belanov; 1990 - Schillaci - Matthaus; 1994 - Romario - Stoichkov; 1998 - Ronaldo - Zidane; 2002 - Kahn — Ronaldo; 2006 — Zidane — Cannavaro; 2010 — Diego Forlan — Lionel Messi; 2014 — Lionel Messi — Cristiano Aveiro; 2018 — Luka Modric — Luka Modric; 2023 — Lionel Messi —? Judging from the 10 years since the World Cup Golden Ball Award was awarded, only Rossi in 1982 and Modric in 2018 won the Golden Ball Award. That is to say, 80% of the cases are the World Cup Golden Ball Award and the Golden Ball Award. There is no one winner of the award! From this point of view, the World Cup Golden Globe Award is not directly related to the Golden Globe Award. It depends more on whether you win the championship while performing well in the World Cup, or on your performance in the Champions League (including the early European Cup Winners' Cup) in that season. And the situation of winning the championship; only Maradona in 1986 was special. At that time, the Ballon d'Or was not awarded to non-European players, which made him regret losing the Ballon d'Or; since then, there has been no such restriction. So does Messi, who won the Golden Globe Award at the 2022 World Cup, still hope to win the Golden Globe Award in 2023? I think we should look at it in two parts: First, Messi is not only the core of Argentina and performed well in this World Cup, but more importantly, Argentina finally won the championship. This will be the most important factor that Messi may win the 2023 Ballon d'Or. , which is also the greatest confidence! Second, this World Cup is not held in summer but in winter, so it cannot be included in the selection of the 2022 Golden Globe Award, but must be included in 2023. This is both a good thing for Messi and also brings some uncertainty. It’s a good thing, because the winner of the Champions League in the 2022 season is Real Madrid. Real Madrid’s Benzema performed exceptionally well that season, and Paris Saint-Germain were eliminated by Real Madrid. If selected in 2022, Benzema will definitely take a larger share. The proportion of votes and who will win in the end is yet to be determined. When it is included in 2023, the disadvantage is that there is a gap of more than half a year between winning the World Cup and the selection of the Ballon d'Or. The popularity will subside to a certain extent, but it will also provide new opportunities for Messi's Paris to perform in the Champions League in the new season. As long as Before it comes, there is an opportunity to create and to change destiny against the will of heaven. If Paris performs well in the Champions League and reaches at least the top four, it will be an important enabler for Messi to win the 8th Golden Ball. But precisely at this point, there is a hidden worry, and that is Director Mbappem. With his ambition, there is a question mark as to whether he will be able to help Messi. Because after all, Messi is the World Cup champion and the World Cup Golden Ball Award (similar to the Most Valuable Player Award). He is the World Cup runner-up and top scorer. Compared with Messi, he still has certain disadvantages. Since Messi returned to Paris on January 4, his teammates lined the streets to welcome him, but he went to the United States to watch the NBA game to avoid it, which is a glimpse of what is going on. If a team wants to win the championship, unity is definitely the second most important factor after strength. But there is precisely this hidden danger in Paris: MNM was originally a striker combination that was not inferior to MSN and MVP, but due to the incompatibility or incompatibility between President Emmanuel Macron and Neymar, and Argentina's victory over France in the Qatar World Cup, Paris' second half of the season became complicated. It's confusing. Messi has been lowering his profile to organize the midfield and assist him, but he may not appreciate it.

4.85E+15,MmtBF1Fr1,3265788052,Vicious NBA,"Some thoughts on today’s hot MVP matchup: 1. We don’t advocate a debate, but Jokic’s performance efficiency of 10 of 13 shots today still beat Tatum, and the comparison of 0 turnovers vs. 5 turnovers is also It's very dazzling. Even if we don't talk about the victory or defeat, it is definitely a day when Jokic scored an extra point. 2. In fact, a big difference in the outcome of the game comes from the performance gap between the shooters. The Nuggets made 17 of 30 three-pointers today, which is definitely a superb performance, while the Celtics performed poorly with 9 of 33 three-pointers. You must know that the Nuggets themselves are already the most accurate three-point team in the league, averaging 12 of 30 shots per game. Today they scored 5 more goals, or 15 points. 3. Anyone who is familiar with the Nuggets bench knows that this team gives away the substitutes when they come on the bench, but today due to the super level three-pointers (Hylander and Chanchar both made 5 of 10 three-pointers), the bench actually won a few points. point. This is partly due to super performance, but it may also be related to Jordan being abandoned. Jordan has DNP in 4 of his last 7 games, and the team has won all 4 games, including 3 wins by double digits (while Jordan has played 27 games this season, only 7 wins by double digits). The remaining three games averaged only 11 minutes per game, which is close to being abandoned. Don't be too surprised if the bench performs better in the second half of the season. After all, replacing a CBA with an ordinary NBA rotation level is almost equivalent to upgrading an ordinary rotation to a small star. 4. If you ask me who has a greater hope for regular season MVP, then I would still prefer Tatum, because there is a certain gap in the overall strength of the team. However, the Nuggets' starting point difference is terrible. If the substitutes who are holding them back are eliminated and the rotation is compressed in the playoffs, they will be a member of the championship group. This cannot be ignored. Moreover, despite Murray's continuous performance this season, he still has a tendency to gradually get better as he accumulates experience. At the same time, he also has an excellent resume of getting stronger in the playoffs. In this case, we have reason to expect a better performance from the Nuggets in the playoffs.",,,,,0,65,72,1/2/23 21:06,Weibo web version,,,

4.85E+15,MmxSj7GCL,5197629060,dr is earthy and strange,"#happynewyear# After the Warriors won their fourth trophy last year, people started praising the general manager and even the boss after praising the coaches and players. This year, the Warriors shouted the slogan of winning both championships and cultivating newcomers. They set up a lineup of five championship starters and five rookie rotations. After ten games, the performance of the three rookies was disastrous and curses were everywhere. However, the boss personally went to the Development League to support Adou. After cheering, everyone suddenly realized that the Warriors Dynasty building was shaking. How much has the current front office contributed to the establishment of the dynasty? Is the ability to draft good enough? 1⃣️The three-point team is here. In the 2006-07 season, Don Nelson, who was fired by Mavericks owner Cuban, came out again. This time he returned to his old club as the head coach of the Golden State Warriors. After returning to the Warriors, Don Nelson took over all the power. After some trade troubles, the Golden State Warriors finally got on the right track. The starting five of Golden State back then were all very aggressive. The bearded Baron Davis was the main point guard, Warriors Jackson and Richardson were the main attackers, and Barnes and Pietrus were built into defensive heroes. The team relied on a style of play in which everyone shot three-pointers and dominated the league. In the playoffs that year, they ranked eighth in the Western Conference and unseated the Dallas Mavericks, the leader of the Western Conference. The NBA at that time was still dominated by slow-paced positional warfare. In that era, if a certain player shot too many three-pointers, he would be reprimanded by the coach. The Golden State Warriors under Don Nelson ran like crazy. In the first year of running in Golden State, their scoring average soared to 116.6 points per game! And for the next three years, they were the most powerful team in the NBA. 2⃣️Curry is here. In 2009, Nelson advocated for Curry with the seventh pick. Said afterwards: ""At that time, I was amazed by his shooting, passing and ball-handling skills, and thought he would become a star."" The Suns also had a strong interest in Curry. Current Warriors coach Cole was the Suns' general manager back then. At that time, they had reached a verbal agreement with the Warriors to trade Stoudemire for the Warriors involving the No. 7 pick, Curry. After the Warriors finally selected Curry with the No. 7 pick, Don Nelson came forward to veto the verbal trade intention reached by the team manager and Cole. In his view, Curry's future development is limitless. ""Curry's shooting ability was more aggressive than Nash at the time. I was a little bit behind him when he first joined the team because the team was very chaotic at that time, but he has the ability to succeed. I developed him very slowly. , I think it's good for him, but he may not agree. At the end of his rookie season, he started to occasionally score 30 points, 35 points."" Nelson added. The thin Curry, partnered with the little Monta Ellis, who is also 1.91 meters tall, in the backcourt made the Warriors, who were strong in offense and weak in defense, even worse. The Warriors' record in the 2009-10 season was only 26 wins and 56 losses. In September 2010, the Warriors announced that assistant coach Keith Smart would replace Don Nelson as coach of the team. 3⃣️The nightmare is coming. According to Jeremy Lin’s recollection, the period when Smart was coaching the Warriors was perhaps the most difficult moment in Curry’s career. In the 10-11 season, head coach Keith Smart was full of doubts and harsh criticism of Curry: No one in the NBA shoots like Curry, and he shouldn't do it! ""Smart often gets angry at Curry!"" Teammate Jeremy Lin at the time talked about Smart's PUA against Curry: If Curry doesn't follow Smart's arrangements, he will yell at Curry, which is right. A humiliation for the players. But Curry just kept silent and continued to maintain what he believed to be a high standard of basketball on the court. ""Stephen Curry has a deep, profound, and very firm belief!"" And just one season later, Keith Smart was fired after leading the Warriors to a winning rate of only 44%. 4⃣️Another Bole came. In 2011, Mark Jackson took over as the head coach of the Warriors and selected Tom with the 11th overall pick. He advocated trading the team's Wild main guard Monta Ellis and strengthening Curry, just like the Lakers traded for Kobe. . Mark Jackson even supported Curry in front of everyone on the team and encouraged Curry: This is your team, you can do it. But at the time, the team owner thought he was crazy. After correcting Curry, Mark Jackson joined forces with the team manager to stop the transaction that wanted to send away Thompson three times. After all, the boss wanted to trade Klay for players such as Love and Howard. Therefore, Thompson was very grateful to Mark Jackson. , and even said: You are the first person to believe in me and Curry. However, the immature splash could not change the Warriors' strong offensive and defensive situation. Curry only played 26 games due to continued injuries, averaging 14.7 points, 3.4 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game, which was not dazzling. Thompson played 29 games as a substitute, averaging 12.5 points, 2.4 rebounds and 2 assists per game, and shooting 41.4% from three-point range. He has shown his true qualities as a shooter. In the 2011-12 season, the Warriors had 23 wins and 43 losses in the regular season. In the 2012-13 season, Assistant General Manager Myers strengthened the team and worked with Jackson to strengthen defensive shortcomings. The biggest gain was the selection of two tough forwards, Harrison Barnes (1st round, 7th overall), Draymond Green (2nd round, 35th overall). Kutang chases the Iron Triangle and starts to put up a fight. Curry began to shine as a superstar, averaging 22.9 points, 6.9 assists, 4 rebounds and 1.6 steals per game, and shooting 45.3% from three-point range. It is worth mentioning that Curry was still not selected for the All-Star Game that season. The Warriors finished sixth in the Western Conference with 47 wins and 35 losses in the regular season. Finally no longer a fish belly. In the 2013-14 season, Iguodala was acquired in a trade, and Dream Green began to be reused. Curry was elected to the All-Star Game for the first time and entered the Western Conference starting lineup. Thompson averaged 18.6 points per game. The Five Little Deaths are beginning to take shape. The Warriors had 51 wins and 31 losses in the 13-14 season. 5⃣️Jackson's tactical system has many problems. In the 2013-14 season, the Warriors ranked last in the league in the number of passes. Jackson's tactic at that time was to give the ball to Curry. Curry holds the ball for 7.4 minutes per game, tenth in the league. In addition, Curry averaged 10.3 pull-up jumpers per game, ranking first in the league, and his shooting percentage was only 44.6%. At that time, only Iguodala and Curry had the ability to handle the ball in the Warriors' backcourt. Barnes mainly plays with the ball in singles, while Clay mainly plays without the ball. In this case, when Iguodala comes off the court, opponents will double-team Curry unscrupulously. That season, the Warriors' offense retreated instead of advancing. The offensive efficiency is 105.3, 12th in the league, and the defensive efficiency is 99.9, third in the league. The Warriors rely on their top-notch defense to rank in the upper reaches of the league for two consecutive years. A team that was strong in offense and weak in defense has become weak in offense and strong in defense. It's obviously difficult to go further. 6⃣️Here comes Cole. On April 6, 2013, the Warriors won 109-107 against the Suns. This marked the first three times the two teams met this season, and the Warriors won each of them. The Warriors haven't swept the Suns in the regular season since the 1976-77 season. If I can't beat you, I'll join you. This is a magic weapon in the NBA. The declining Suns have been unable to retain their ambitious general manager Cole, who has long coveted Curry and has been flirting with the Warriors boss. In 2014, over the unanimous objections of Kutangchai, the disobedient Jackson was fired. After Cole took the stage, he knew that Curry's physical condition was easy to be attacked by the opponent, so he promoted Green to the starting lineup and gradually became the center of offense and defense. He continued to increase Curry's off-ball movement, allowing the Warriors to change from Curry holding a lot of the ball to With a lot of passing and cutting, the offense jumped to second place in the league. thereby becoming a championship team. Since then, the team has been built around Kurtang. Rooney, Livingston, and KD have joined one after another. The offensive methods have become more and more stable, and they have won four championships in eight years. Conclusion Ku Tang Chui is the soul of the dynasty. Like a rose, Curry is the flower that shines brightly when exposed to the sun. He is the core of the team and has gone through expectations, denial, belief, and doubt all the way; Tom is the green leaf, very confident, but often unable to distinguish himself. Is it a captain or a sailor? Chasing dreams is the thorny branch, knowing that he is the indispensable guard with a knife in the library. The small ball era was created by Nelson, Kutangchai was integrated during the Jackson era, and existed before Cole came. The current management has only proved that it has great experience in Taobao's immediate combat ability among fringe players to assist Kutangchai and make them flourish, but their draft ability has not been verified.
